            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Several things concerning Hell, and helliſh tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, opened, cleared and improved againſt all Atheiſts, and all others that boldly aſſert, that there is no Hell, but what is in us. Some other points of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance are here cleared and opened, which other Authors (ſo far as the Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor hath read) have paſſed over them in great ſilence, all tending to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſtrong, and ſupport, peace, comfort, ſettlement and ſatisfaction of poor, weak, doubting, trembling, ſtaggering Chriſtians.</p>

            <head>Serious and Weighty QUESTIONS, CLEARLY And Satisfactorily Anſwered.</head>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion or Caſe is this.</p>
            <p>1. Queſt. <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat are the ſpecial Remedies, Means, or Helps againſt che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, or keeping up of any ſpecial or peculiar ſin, either in heart or life; againſt the Lord, or againſt the Light &amp; Conviction of a mans own Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the Reſolution of this Queſtion, I ſhall promiſe a few things that may clear my way.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt: When mens hearts are ſincere with God; when they don't indulge, cherriſh, or keep up any known
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66517:13"/> Trangreſſion in their hearts, or lives againſt the Lord. They may on very good grounds, plead an intereſt in God, in Chriſt, and in the Covenant of Grace, though their Corruptions prevail againſt them, and too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently worſt them, and lead them Captive, as is moſt evident in theſe ſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Scriptures, 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5. Pſal. 65. 3. Rom. 7. 23. 25. Iſa. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>But now when any mans heart doth condemn him for dealing deceitfully and guilefully with God, in this, or that, or the other particular; or for connivings, or wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any known Tranſgreſſion that is kept up, either in his heart, or life, againſt the Lord; and againſt the light of his own Conſcience, which he will not let go, nor in good earneſt uſe the means, whereby it ſhould be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mortified: It is inot to be expected that ſuch a perſon can come to any clearneſs, or ſatisfaction about their intereſt in Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace, and their right to the great things of that other world; when a perſon will dally with ſin, and will be playing with ſnares and baits, &amp; allow a ſecret liberty in his heart to ſin, conniving at many workings of it, and not ſetting upon Mortification with earneſt endeavours; though they are convinced, yet they are not perſwaded to ariſe with all their might, againſt the Lords Enemies, but do his work negligently, which is an accurſed thing; and for this, God ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s ſuch a perſon into ſore ſtraits, and lets him wander in the dark, without any ſight, ſenſe, or aſſurance of their gracious eſtate or intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> ſhould perfectly have rooted out the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but becauſe they did it but by halfs, and did not engage all their power and ſtrength againſt them, therefore God left them to be as Thorns in their eyes, and as Goads in their ſides. So when men have taken Chriſt's Preſs-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and are engaged to fight with all their might, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Rebels that war againſt him in their hearts, ways, and walkings; and to perſue the Victory to the utmoſt, till their Spiritual Enemies lye dead at their feet,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66517:13"/> and yet they do but trifle and make ſlender oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſins: This provokes God to ſtand afar off, and to hide his Reconciled Face from them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, when men are really in Chriſt, they ought not to queſtion their ſtate in him; but yet a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be clamorous, and full of objections, and God will not ſpeak peace unto it, till it be humbled at his foot. God will make his deareſt Children know that it is a bitter thing to be bold with ſin. Now before I lay down the Remedies, give me leave to ſhew you what it is to indulge ſin, or when a man may be ſaid to indulge or cheriſh, or keep up any known Tranſgreſſion in his Soul againſt the Lord; now for a clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me in this particular, take me thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt: To indulge ſin, or to cherriſh it. It is to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> daily proviſion for it, <hi>Rom. 13. ult.</hi> it is to give the Breaſt to it, and to feed it, and nouriſh it, as fond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do feed and humour the ſick Child, the darling Child; it muſt have what it will, and do what it will; it muſt not be croſt. Now when men ordinarily, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, commonly, are ſtudious and laborious to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſin, then ſin is indulged by them. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: When ſin is commonly, habitually, ſweet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and pleaſant to the Soul; when a man takes a daily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in ſin, then ſin is indulged, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. You read of them that had pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa. 66. 3. And their Soul delighteth in their Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Prov. 2. 14. <hi>who rejoyce to do evil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: When men commonly, habitually ſide with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſin, and take up Armes in the deſence of ſin, and in defiance of the commands of God, the motions of the Spirit, the checks of Conſcience, and the reproofs of others, then ſin is indulged. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: When men ordinarily, habitually do yeild <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a quiet, free, willing, and total ſubjection to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and commands of ſin, then ſin is indulged; that man that is wholly addicted and devoted to the ſervice of ſin, that man indulges ſin. Now in none of theſe ſenſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66517:14"/> does any Godly man indulge any one ſin in his Soul. Though ſin lives in him, yet he doth not live in ſin. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that hath drink in him, is not in drink. A Child of God may ſlip into a ſin, as a Sheep may ſlip into the mire; but he does not, nor cannot wallow in ſin as the Swine does in the mire, nor yet keep on in a Road of ſin, as Sinners do, <hi>Pſal. 139. 24. See if there be any way of Wickedneſs in me.</hi> A courſe, a Trade of ſin is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the truth or ſtate of grace, <hi>Job. 10. 7. Thou knoweſt that I am not Wicked.</hi> He doth not ſay, thou knoweſt that I am not a Sinner, or thou knoweſt that I have not ſinned: No! for the beſt of Saints are Sinners, though the worſt and weakeſt of Saints are not wicked. Every real Chriſtian, is a renewed Chriſtian; &amp; every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Chriſtian takes his denomination from his reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and not from the remainers of Corruptions in him; and therefore ſuch a one may well look God in the Face, and ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I am not Wicked.</hi> Weakneſſes are chargeable upon me, but Wickedneſſes are not chargeable upon me. And certainly, that man gives a ſtrong demonſtration of his own uprightneſs, who dares appeal to God himſelf that he is not wicked.</p>
            <p>That no Godly man does, or can indulge himſelf in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courſe, or way, or Trade of ſin, may be thus made evident.</p>
            <p>Firſt: He ſins not with allowance; when he does evil, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he diſallows of the evil he does, <hi>Rom. 7. 15. For that which I do, I allow not:</hi> A Chriſtian is ſometimes wherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and whirled away by ſin before he is a ware, or hath time to conſider of it. See <hi>Pſal. 119. 1. 3. 1 Joh. 3. 9. Prov.</hi> 16. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly: A Godly man hates all known ſin, <hi>Pſal</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 119. 128. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> True hatred is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, againſt the whole kind. That contrariety to ſin, which is in a real Chriſtian, ſprings from an inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nature, or principle, and ſo is to the whole ſpecies, or kind of ſin, and is irreconcileable to any ſin whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. As contrarieties of nature, are to the whole kind,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66517:14"/> as light is contrary to darkneſs, and fire to all water: ſo this contrariety to all ſin, ariſing from the inward man, is univerſal to all ſin. He who hates a Toad, becauſe it is a Toad, hates every Toad; and he who hates a Godly man, becauſe he is Godly, he hates every Godly man; and ſo he who hates ſin, becauſe 'tis ſin, he hates every ſin, <hi>Rom. 7. 15. What I hate, that do I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: Every Godly man would fain have his ſins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not only pardoned, but deſtroyed; his heart is alienated from his ſins, and therefore nothing will ſerve him, or ſatisfie him, but the blood and death of his ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 20 chap. 30. 22. <hi>Hoſ. 14. 8. Rom. 8. 24. Saul</hi> hated <hi>David,</hi> and ſought his life; and <hi>Haman</hi> hated <hi>Mord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cat,</hi> and ſought his deſtruction; and <hi>Abſalom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> and kill'd him; <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate hated the Chriſtians, and put many thouſands of them to death. The great thing that a Chriſtian has in his eye, in all the duties he performs, and in all the Ordinances that he attends, is the blood, and death, and ruine of his ſins.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: Every Godly man groans under the burden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of ſin, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. For we that are in this Tabernacle, do groan, being burdened.</hi> Never did any Porter groan more to be delivered from his heavy burden, than a Chriſtian groans to be delivered from the burden of ſin, the burden of affliction; the burden of temptation, the burden of deſertion, the burden of oppoſition, the burden of perſecution, the burden of ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is nothing to the burden of ſin; ponder upon that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. ver. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24 ver.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Every Godly man combats and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with all known ſin.

               </gap> King. 14. 30. 31. Though ſin and grace were not born together, and though ſin and grace ſhall never die together, yet whiles a Believer lives in this world, they muſt live together; and whilſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66517:15"/> ſin and grace do cohabit together, they will ſtill be oppoſing and conflicting one with another.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: Every gracious heart is ſtill a crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his ſins; he crys out to God to ſubdue them; he crys out to Chriſt to crucifie them; he crys out to the Spirit to mortifie them; he crys out to faithful Miniſters to arm him againſt them; and he crys out to ſincere Chriſtians, that they would pray hard that he may be made Victorious over them. Now certainly, it is a moſt ſure ſign that ſin has not gained a mans heart, a mans love, nor his conſent, but committed a Rape upon his Soul, when he crys out bitterly againſt his ſin. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, That if the Raviſhed Virgin, under the Law, cryed out, ſhe was guiltleſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27. certainly ſuch as cry out of their ſins, and that would not for all the world indulge themſelves in a way of ſin; ſuch are guiltleſs before the Lord. That which a Chriſtian does not indulge himſelf in, that he do's not do in divine account. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly: The fixed purpoſes and deſigns of a Godly man, is not to ſin, <hi>Pſal. 17. 3. I am purpoſed that my</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>

Though may have many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular failings, yet my general purpoſe is not to ſin, <hi>Pſal. 39. 1. I ſaid, I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not with my tongue:</hi> I will keep my mouth with a Bridle, while the wicked is before me. When ever a Godly man ſins, he ſins againſt the general purpoſe of his Soul. <hi>David</hi> laid a Law upon his tongue; he uſes three words in the firſt and ſecond verſes to the ſame purpoſe, which is, as if he ſhould ſay in plain <hi>Engliſh, I was ſilent, I was ſilent, I was ſilent;</hi> and all this to expreſs how he kept in his paſſion, that he might not offend with his tongue. Though a Godly man ſins, yet he doth not purpoſe to ſin, for his purpoſes are fixt againſt ſin; Holineſs is his high-way; and as ſin is it ſelf a by-way, ſo it is beſides his way. The honeſt Traveller purpoſes to keep ſtraight on his way; ſo that if at any time he miſſe his way, he miſſes his purpoſe. Though <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt, yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66517:15"/> he did not purpoſe to deny Chriſt; yea, the ſetled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Soul, was rather to die with Chriſt, than to deny Chriſt, <hi>Math. 26. 35.

            <p>
               <hi>Jerom</hi> writes of a brave Woman, who being upon the wrack, bid her Perſecutors do their worſt, for ſhe was reſolved that ſhe would rather die then lye.</p>

            <p>Eleventhly: Every gracious Soul ſets himſelf moſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> reſolutely, valiantly, and habitually againſt his ſpecial ſins, his conſtitution ſins, his moſt prevalent ſins, <hi>Pſal. 18. 23. I was alſo upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> Certainly that which is the ſpecial ſin of a Godly man, is his ſpecial burden; it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, but lamented; there is no ſin which coſts him ſo much ſorrow as that, to which either the temper of his body, or the occaſions of his life leads him. That ſin which he finds his heart moſt ſet upon, he ſets his heart, his whole ſoul moſt againſt. The Scripture gives much evidence that <hi>David</hi> (though a man after Gods own heart) was very apt to fall into the ſin of Lying, he uſed many unlawful ſhifts; we read of his often faultring in that kind, when he was in ſtraits, and hard put to it, 1 <hi>Sam. 21. 2. 8. 1 Sam. 27. 8, 10, &amp;c.</hi> but it is as clear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66517:16"/> in Scripture, that his heart was ſet againſt lying; and that it was the grief and daily burden of his Soul: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that ſin is a mans greateſt burden and grief, which he prays moſt to be delivered from. O! how earneſtly did <hi>David</hi> pray to be delivered from the ſin of lying, <hi>(Pſal. 119. 29.) Keep me from the way of lying.</hi> And as he prayed earneſtly againſt lying, ſo he as earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted it; <hi>(ver. 163.) I hate and abhor Lying.</hi> Though Lying was <hi>Davids</hi> ſpecial ſin, yet he hated and abhorred it as he did Hell it ſelf. And he tells us how he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or afflicted rather with that ſin, whatſoever it was, which was his Iniquity, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 31. 10,) my life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighings; my ſtrength faileth, and my bones are conſumed, or Moth-eaten as the Hebrew has it, (here are deep expreſſions of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Spirit;) and why all this? Mark, he gives you the reaſon of it in the ſame verſe, <hi>becauſe of mine Iniquity:</hi> as if he had ſaid, there is a baſe corruption which ſo haunts and doggs me, that my life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing: He found (it ſeems) his heart running out to ſome ſin or other, which yet was ſo far from being a beloved ſin, a boſom ſin, a darling ſin; that it was the breaking of his heart, and the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his bones. So <hi>Pſal. 38. 18. I will declare mine Iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi> There is no ſin that a gracious heart is more perfectly ſet againſt, than againſt his ſpecial ſin; for by this ſin God firſt, has been moſt diſhonored; and ſecondly, Chriſt moſt crucified; and thirdly, the Spirit moſt grieved; and fourthly, Conſcience moſt wounded; and fifthly, Satan moſt advantaged; and ſixthly, Mercies moſt imbittered; and ſeaventhly, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties moſt hindred; and eighthly, Fears and doubts moſt raiſed and increaſed; and ninethly, Afflictions moſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied; and tenthly, Death made moſt formidable and terrible, and therefore he breaks out againſt this ſin with the greateſt deteſtation and abhorrency. <hi>Ephraims</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſin was Idolatry, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 17. he thought the choiceſt gold and ſilver in the world hardly good enough to frame

An honeſt Traveller may ſtep out of the Kings high-way into a Houſe, a Wood, a Cloſe; but his work, his buſineſs is to go on in the Kings high-way; ſo the buſineſs, the work of an upright man, is to depart from evil. 'Tis poſſible for an upright man to ſtep into a ſinful path, or to touch upon ſinful facts; but his main way, his principal work and buſineſs is to depart from Iniquity; as a Bee may light upon a Thiſtle, but her work is to be gathering at flowers; or as a Sheep may ſlip into the dirt, but its work is to be

In this Book of <hi>Solomons</hi> Song, Chriſt is called the Churches Beloved juſt twenty times. I might turn you to many other Scriptures, but in the mouth of twenty Witneſſes you may be very clearly and fully ſatisfied, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Saints Beloved. 1. When the Dutch Martyr was askt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not love his Wife and Children, he Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Were all the World a lump of gold, and in my hand to diſpoſe of, I would give it to live with my Wife and Children in a Priſon, but Chriſt is dearer to me than all.</hi> 2. Saith <hi>Jerom, If my Father ſhould ſtand before me, and if my Mother ſhould hang upon me, and my Brethren ſhould preſs about me, I would break through my Brethren, throw down my Mother, and tread under-foot my Father, that I might cleave the faſter and cloſer unto Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 3. That Bleſſed Virgin in <hi>Baſil,</hi> being condemned for Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the fire, and having her Eſtate and Life offered her if ſhe would worſhip Idols, cryed out. <hi>Let money periſh, and life vaniſh, Chriſt is better than all.</hi> 4. Love made <hi>Hierom</hi> to ſay, <hi>O! my Saviour, didſt thou dye for love of me, a love more dolorous than death, but to me a death more lovely than love it ſelf. I cannot live, love thee and be longer from thee 5. Henry Voes</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I</hi>

               <hi>had ten heads, they ſhould all off for Chriſt. 6. John Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Martyr ſaid, <hi>If every hair of my head were a man, they ſhould all ſuffer for the Faith of Chriſt. 7. Ignatius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let fire, racks, pullies, yea, &amp; all the torments of Hell, come on me, ſo I may win Chriſt. 8. George Carpenter</hi> being asked whether he loved not his Wife and Children, when they all wept before them; Anſwered, <hi>My Wife and Children are dearer to me than all</hi> Bavaria, <hi>yet for the love of Chriſt, I know them not. 9. O Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, I love thee more than all my Goods, and I love thee more than all my Friends, yea, I love thee more than my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf. 10. Auſtin</hi> ſaith he, would willingly go through Hell to Chriſt. 11. Another ſaith, <hi>He had rather be in his Chimney-Corner with Chriſt, than in Heaven without him.</hi> 12. Another crys out, <hi>I had rather have one Chriſt than a thouſand Worlds;</hi> by all which 'tis moſt evident, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Saints beſt Beloved, and not this or that ſin.</p>
            <p>Now by theſe 13 Arguments. 'tis moſt clear that no gracious Chriſtian do's, or can indulge himſelf in any Trade, courſe, or way of ſin.</p>
            <p>Yea, by theſe thirteen Arguments 'tis moſt evident that no Godly man, has, or can have any one beloved ſin, any one boſom, darling ſin, though many worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, both in their Preaching and Writings, make a great noiſe about the Saints beloved ſins, about their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom darling ſins. I readily grant, that all Unregenerate perſons have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins; but that no ſuch ſins are chargable upon the Regenerate is ſufficiently demonſtrated by the thirteen Arguments laſt cited: And O! that this were wiſely and ſeriouſly conſidered of, both by Miniſters and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; there is no known ſin that a Godly man is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at, and that he would not be rid of. There is as much difference between ſin in a Regenerate perſon, and in an Unregenerate perſon, as there is between poyſon in a Man, and poyſon in a Serpent: Poyſon in a mans body, is moſt offenſive and burdenſome, and he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66517:18"/> uſes all Arts and Antidotes to expel it, and get rid; but poyſon in a Serpent, is in its natural place, and is moſt pleaſing, and delightful: So ſin in a Regenerate man is moſt offenſive and burdenſome, and he readily uſes all holy means and Antidotes to expel it, and to get rid of it: But ſin in an Unregenerate man is moſt pleaſing and delightful, it being in its natural place. A Godly man ſtill enters his proteſt againſt ſin; a gracious Soul, while he commits ſin, hates the ſin he commits.</p>
            <p>O Sirs! there is a vaſt difference between a ſpecial and a beloved ſin, a darling ſin, a boſom-ſin: <hi>Noah</hi> had a ſin, and <hi>Lot</hi> had a ſin, and <hi>Jacob</hi> had a ſin, and <hi>Job</hi> had a ſin, and <hi>David</hi> had a ſin, which was his ſpecial ſin; but neither of theſe had any ſin which was their beloved ſin, their boſom ſin, their darling ſin; that paſſage in <hi>Job</hi> 31. 33. is obſervable. <hi>If I covered my Tranſgreſſion as</hi> Adam, <hi>by hiding mine Iniquity in my Boſom.</hi> Mark in this Text, while <hi>Job</hi> calleth ſome ſin or other his Iniquity, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth that he had any beloved ſin; for ſaith he, <hi>Did I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No, I did not.</hi> A Godly man may have many ſins, yet he hath not one beloved ſin, one boſom ſin, one darling ſin; he may have ſome particular ſin, to which the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part of his will may ſtrongly incline, and to which his unmortified affections may run out with violence too; yet he hath no ſin he bears any good will to, or doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or cordially effect. Mark, that may be called a mans particular way of ſinning, which yet we cannot, we may not call his beloved ſin, his boſom ſin, his darling ſin; for it may be his greateſt grief and torment, and may coſt him more ſorrow and tears than all the reſt of his ſins; it may be a Tyrant uſurping power over him, when it is not the delight and pleaſure of his Soul. A Godly man may be more prone to fall into ſome one ſin rather than another; it may be Paſſion, or Pride, or Slaviſh fear, or Worldlineſs, or Hypocriſie; or this, or that, or tother Vanity; yet are not theſe his beloved ſins, his

               </gap>e the Enemies he hates, and abhors; theſe are the grand-Enemies that he prays againſt, and complains of, and mourns over; theſe are the potent Rebels that his Soul crys out moſt againſt, and by which his Soul ſuffers the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Mark, no ſin: but Chriſt is the dearly beloved of a Chriſtians Soul; Chriſt, and not this ſin, or that, is the chiefeſt of ten thouſand to a gracious Soul; and yet ſome particular corruption or other may more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſt a Believer, and lead him Captive; but then the Believer crys out moſt againſt that particular ſin: O! ſaith he, this is mine Iniquity; this is the <hi>Saul,</hi> the <hi>Pharoah</hi> that is always a purſuing after the blood of my Soul. Lord let this <hi>Saul</hi> fall by the Sword of thy Spirit; let this <hi>Pharoah</hi> be drown'd in the Red Sea of thy Sons blood. O! Sirs, It is a point of very great importance, for gracious Souls to underſtand the vaſt difference that there is between a beloved ſin, and this, or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin, violently Tyrannizing over them; for this is moſt certain, whoſoever giveth up himſelf freely, willingly, cheerfully, habitually, to the ſervice of any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Luſt, or Sin, he is in the ſtate of Nature, under wrath, and in the way to eternal Ruine.</p>
            <p>Now a little to ſhew the vanity, folly, and falſhood of that Opinion that is received, and commonly avowed by Miniſters and Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath his beloved ſin, his boſom ſin, his darling ſin; ſeriouſly and frequently conſider with me of theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt: That this Opinion is not bottomed or founded upon any clear Scripture or Scriptures, either in the Old or New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Secondly: This Opinion that is now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> runs counter croſs to all thoſe thirteen Arguments, but now alledged, and to all thoſe ſcores of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which thoſe Arguments are confirmed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: This Opinion that is now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has a great tendancy to harden and ſtrong then wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66517:19"/> men in their ſins; for when they ſhall hear and read that the Saints, the dearly beloved of God, have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins, what inferences will they not be ready to make: What are theſe they call Saints, wherein are they better than us? have we our beloved ſins? ſo have they Have we our boſom ſins? ſo have they; have we our darling ſins? ſo have they. They have their beloved ſins, and yet are beloved of God, and why not we? why not we? Saints have their beloved ſins, and yet God is kind to them; and why then not to us, why not to us alſo? Saints have their beloved ſins, and yet God will ſave them; and why then ſhould we believe that God will damn us? Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins, and therefore certainly they are not to be ſo dearly loved, and highly prized, and greatly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Miniſters would make us believe. Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins, and therefore what Iniquity is it to account and call them Hypocrites, Deceivers, Diſſemblers, that pretend they have a great deal of love to God, and love to Chriſt, and love to his Word, and love to his ways; and yet for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this, they have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins. Surely theſe mens hearts are not right with God; with much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: If Chriſt be really the Saints beloved, then ſin is not their beloved, but Chriſt is the Saints beloved, as I have formerly clearly proved; and therefore ſin is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not there beloved. A man may as well ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as have two Beloveds, <hi>viz.</hi> a Beloved-Chriſt, and a beloved Luſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Thoſe ſupernatural Graces, or thoſe Divine qualities that are infuſed into the Soul at firſt converſion, are contrary to all ſin, and oppoſite to all ſin, and engages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the heart againſt all ſin; and therefore a converted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can have no beloved ſin, no boſom ſin, no darling ſin. Seriouſly weigh this Argument.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: This Opinion may ſill many weak Chriſtians
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66517:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> with many needleſs fears, doubts, and jealouſies about their Spiritual and Eternal conditions Weak Chriſtians are very apt to reaſon thus; Surely my Converſion is not ſound; my Spiritual Eſtate is not good; my Heart is not right with God; a ſaving work has never yet paſt upon me in power: I fear I have not the root of the matter in me: I fear I have never had a through change: I fear I have never yet been effectually call'd out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into his marvellous light: I fear <hi>I</hi> have never yet been Eſpouſed to Chriſt: <hi>I</hi> fear the Spirit of God hath never taken up my heart for his Habitation: <hi>I</hi> fear that after all my high profeſſion, <hi>I</hi> ſhall at laſt be found an Hypocrite: <hi>I</hi> fear the Execution of that dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Math. 25. Go ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c. And why all this, O poor Soul? Anſwer, Becauſe <hi>I</hi> carry about with me my beloved ſins, my boſom ſins, my darling ſins. Miniſters had need be very wary in their Preaching &amp; Writing, that they don't bring forth fuel to feed the fears and doubts of weak Chriſtians, it being a great part of their work, to arm weak Chriſtians againſt their fears and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: But</p>
            <p>Seaventhly: This Opinion that is now under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is an Opinion that is very repugnant to ſound and ſincere Repentance; for ſound, ſincere Repentance includes and takes in a divorce, an alienation, a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſeparation, and a turning from all ſin, without exception or reſervation. One of the firſt works of the Spirit upon the Soul, is the dividing between all known ſin and the ſoul; 'tis a making an utter breach betwixt all ſin and the ſoul; 'tis a diſſolving of that old League that has been between a Sinner and his ſins, yea, between a Sinner and his beloved Luſts. One of the firſt works of the Spirit, is to make a man to look upon all his ſins as Enemies, yea as his greateſt Enemies, and to deal with his ſins as Enemies, and to hate and loath them as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to fear them as Enemies, and to arm againſt them as Enemies. Seriouſly ponder upon theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 28. 30, 31. 14. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66517:20"/> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 101. 104. 128. verſes. True Repentance is a turning from all ſin, without any Reſervation, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; he never truly repented of any ſin, whoſe heart is not turned againſt every ſin. The true penitent caſts off all the rags of Old <hi>Adam,</hi> he is for throwing down every ſtone of the old building; he will not leave a horn, nor a hoof behind. The reaſons of turning from ſin, are univerſally binding to a penitent Soul. There are the ſame reaſons and grounds for a penitent mans turning from every ſin, as there is for his turning from any one ſin. Do you turn from this or that ſin, becauſe the Lord has forbid it, why upon the ſame ground you muſt turn from every ſin; for God has forbid every ſin as well as this or that particular ſin. There is the ſame Authority, forbidding or commanding in all; and if the Authority of God awes a man from one ſin, it will awe him from all. He that turns from any one ſin, becauſe it is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the holy and righteous Law of God, he will turn from every ſin upon the ſame account. He that turns from any one ſin, becauſe it is a diſhonour to God, a reproach to Chriſt, a grief to the Spirit, a wound to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will upon the ſame grounds turn from every ſin.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But wherein does a true penitential turning from all ſin conſiſt? Anſw.</hi> In theſe ſix things.</p>
            <p>Firſt in the alienation and inward averſation and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of the Soul from the love and liking of all ſin, and from all free and voluntary ſubjection unto ſin, the heart being filled with a loathing and deteſtation of all ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. 128. as that which is moſt contrary to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly: In the wills deteſtation and hatred of all ſin, when the very bent and inclination of the will is ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> againſt all ſin, and oppoſes and croſſes all ſin, and is ſet upon the ruine and deſtruction of all ſin, then the Penitent is turned from all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. 19. 21. 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. 14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. When the will ſtands upon ſuch terms of defiance with all ſin, as that it will never enter into a league of friendſhip with any ſin, then is the Soul turned from every ſin.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:66517:21"/>
            <p>Thirdly: In the judgments, turning away from all ſin, by diſapproving, diſallowing, and condemning all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. O! ſaith the judgment of a Chriſtian, ſin is the greateſt evil in all the world, 'tis the only thing God abhors, and that brought Jeſus Chriſt to the Croſs, that damns Souls, that ſhuts Heaven, and that has laid the foundations of Hell. O! It is the pricking thorn in my eye, the deadly arrow in my ſide, the two-edged-ſword that hath wounded my Conſcience, and ſlain my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and ſeparated between God and my Soul. O! ſin is that which hath hindred my prayers, and imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mercies, and put a ſting into all my croſſes; and therefore I can't but diſapprove of it, and diſallow of it, and condemn it to death, yea, to Hell from whence it came.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: In the purpoſe and reſolution of the ſoul, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the ſoul ſincerely purpoſing and reſolving, never willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilfully, or wickedly to tranſgreſs any more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 3. The general purpoſe and reſolution of my heart is not to tranſgreſs, though particular failings may attend me; yet my reſolutions and purpoſes are firmly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt doing evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1. The true Penitent holds up his purpoſes and reſolutions to keep off from ſin, and to keep cloſe with God, though he be not able in every thing, and at all times to make good his purpoſes and reſolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: In the earneſt and unfeigned deſires, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> endeavours of the Soul to abandon all ſin, to forſake all ſin, and to be rid of all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22, 23. You know when a prudent, tender, indulgent Father ſees hs Child to fail and come ſhort in that which he enjoyns him to do; yet knowing that his deſires and endeavours is to pleaſe him, and ſerve him, he will not be harſh, rigid, ſowre, or ſevere towards him; but will ſpare him, and exerciſe much tenderneſs, and indulgence towards him; and will God, will God, whoſe mercies reach above the Heavens, and whoſe compaſſions are infinite, and whoſe love is like himſelf, carry it worſe towards his Children
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66517:21"/> then men do carry it towards theirs? Surely no. God's Fatherly indulgence accepts of the will for the work, <hi>Heb. 13. 18. 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 12. Certainly, a ſick man is not more deſirous to be rid of all his Diſeaſes, nor a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be freed from all his bolts and chains, than the true Penitent is deſirous to be rid of all his ſins.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly: In the common and ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".6"/> ſhunning, and avoyding of all known occaſions of ſin, yea, and all temptations, provocations, inducements, and enticements to ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That royal Law, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 22. Abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> is a Law that is very precious in a Penitent mans eye, and commonly lyes warm upon a Penitent mans heart; ſo that take him in his ordinary courſe, and you ſhall find him very ready to ſhun, and be ſhie of the very appearance of ſin, of the very ſhews and ſhadows of ſin. Job <hi>made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his eyes,</hi> Job. 31. 1. and <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his bold tempting Miſtriſs, <hi>to lye by her, or to be with her,</hi> Gen. 39. 10. And <hi>David</hi> when himſelf, <hi>would not ſit with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ain perſons,</hi> Pſal. 26. 3, 4, 5. Now a true penitential turning from all ſins, lyes in theſe ſix things, and therefore you had need look about you; for if there be any one way of wickedneſs, wherein you walk, and which you are reſolved you will not forſake, you are no true penitents, and you will certainly loſe your ſouls, and be miſerable for ever.</p>
            <p>This Opinion that is now under-conſideration, is an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> opinion that will exceedingly deject many precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and cauſe them greatly to hang down their heads, eſpecially in four days. 1. In the day of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. 2. In the day of perſonal affliction. 3. In the day of death. 4. In the great day of account.</p>
            <p>Firſt: In a day of common Calamity, when the Sword <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is drunk with the blood of the ſlain; or when the raging Peſtilence lays thouſands in heap upon heap, or when Fevours, Agues, Gripes, and other Diſeaſes, carry hundreds every week to their long homes. O! now the remembrance of a mans beloved ſins, his boſom ſins, his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66517:22"/> darling ſins (if a Saint had any ſuch ſins) will be very apt to fill his ſoul with fears, dreads, and perplexities: Surely now God will meet with me, now God will avenge himſelf on me for my beloved ſins, my boſom ſins, my darling ſins: O! how righteous a thing is it with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my beloved luſts, to ſweep me away by theſe ſweeping Judgments that are abroad in the Earth? On the contrary, how ſweet and comfortable a thing is it, when in a day of common Calamity, a Chriſtian can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God, and appeal to Conſcience, that though he has many weakneſſes, and infirmities that hang upon him, that yet he has no beloved ſin, no boſom ſin, no darling ſin, that either God or Conſcience can charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. O! ſuch a conſideration as this, may be as life from the dead to a gracious Chriſtian, in the midſt of all the common Calamities that do's ſurround him; and that hourly threaten him.</p>
            <p>Secondly: In the day of perſonal Affections, when the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſmarting Rod is upon him, and God writes bitter things againſt him; when the Hand of the Almighty has toucht him in his Name, Eſtate, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O! now the remembrance of a mans beloved ſins, his boſom ſins, his darling ſins, (if a Saint had any ſuch ſins) <hi>will be as the hand writing upon the Wall</hi> (Dan. 5. 5, 6.) <hi>that will make his counteance to be changed, his thoughts to be troubled, his joynts to be looſed, and his knees to be daſhed one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> O! now a Chriſtian will be ready to conclude, O! 'tis my beloved ſins, my boſom ſins, my darling ſins that has cauſed God to put this bitter cup into my hand, <hi>and that has provokt him to give me gall and wormwood to drink,</hi> Lam. 3. 19. Whereas on the contrary, when a man under all his perſonal tryals, though they are many, and great, yet can lift up his head and appeal to God and Conſcience, that though he has many ſinful weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and infirmities hanging upon him, yet neither God nor Conſcience can charge upon him any beloved ſins, any boſom ſins, any darling ſins: O! ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as this, will help a man to bare up bravely,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66517:22"/> ſweetly, cheerfully, patiently, and contentedly, under the heavieſt hand of God, as is evident in that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Job:</hi> who ſo ſorely afflicted as <hi>Job?</hi> and yet no beloved ſin, no boſom ſin, no darling ſin, being chargable upon him by God or Conſcience <hi>(Job.</hi> 10. 7. chap. 31. 33.) How bravely, ſweetly, and Chriſtianly do's <hi>Job</hi> bear up under thoſe ſad changes and dreadful providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that would have broke a thouſand of ſuch mens hearts, upon whom God and Conſcience could charge beloved ſins, boſom ſins, darling ſins? But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: In the day of death; <hi>Death is the King of</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>terrors,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>and the terror of Kings,</hi> as the Philoſopher ſpeaks: Oh how terrible will this King of terrors be to that man upon whom God and Conſcience can charge beloved ſins, boſom ſins, darling ſins: This is certain, when a wicked man comes to die, all the ſins that ever he committed don't ſo grieve him, and terrifie him, ſo ſad him, and ſink him, and raiſe ſuch horrors and terrors in him, and put him into ſuch a hell on this ſide Hell, as his beloved ſins, his boſom ſins, his darling ſins; and had Saints their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins, Ah what a Hell of horror and terror would theſe ſins raiſe in their ſouls, when they come to lye upon a dying Bed! But now when a Child of God ſhall lye upon a dying Bed, and ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt, and Conſcience thou knoweſt, that though I have had many and great failings, yet there are no beloved ſins, no boſom ſins, no darling ſins, that are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon me. Lord thou knoweſt, and Conſcience thou knoweſt: 1. That there is no known ſin that I don't hate and abhor. 2. That there is no known ſin that I don't combat and conflict with. 3. That there is no known ſin that I don't grieve and mourn over. 4. That there is no known ſin that I would not preſently, freely, willingly, and heartily be rid of. 5. That there is no known ſin that I don't in ſome weak meaſure endeavour in the uſe of holy means to be delivered from. 6. That there is no known ſin, the effectual ſubduing and mortifying of which, would not adminiſter matter of the</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:66517:23"/> 
               <hi>greateſt joy and comfort to me.</hi> Now when God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall acquit a man upon a dying Bed, of beloved ſins, of boſom ſins, of darling ſins, who can expreſs the joy, the comfort, the peace, the ſupport that ſuch an acquittance will fill a man with?</p>
            <p>Fourthly: In the day of Account, the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry thoughts of which day, too many, is more terrible than Death it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſelf, ſuch Chriſtians as are Captivated under the power of this opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins; ſuch cannot but greatly fear, and tremble to appear before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God. O! ſaith ſuch poor hearts, how ſhall we be able to anſwer for beloved ſins, our boſom ſins, our darling ſins, as for infirmities, weakneſſes, and follies that has attended us, we can plead with God, and tell him; Lord, when Grace has been weak, Corruptions ſtrong, Temptations great, and thy Spirit withdrawn, and we off from our Watch, we have been worſted and captivated. But what ſhall we ſay as to our beloved ſins, our boſom ſins, our darling ſins; O theſe fill us with terror and horror, and how ſhall we be able to hold up our heads before the Lord, when he ſhall reckon with us for theſe ſins. But now when a poor Child of God thinks of the day of Account, and is able, through grace, to ſay, <hi>Lord, though we cannot clear our ſelves of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many ſinful weakneſſes, yet we can comfortably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in thee, and our Conſciences, that we have no beloved ſins, no boſom ſins, no darling ſins.</hi> O with what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, confidence, and boldneſs, will ſuch poor hearts hold up their heads in the day of Account, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can plead thoſe ſix things before a Judgment ſeat, that he pleaded in the third particular, when he lay upon a dying Bed? how will his fears vaniſh, and how will his hopes and and hopes and heart revive, and how comfortably and boldly will he ſtand before a Judgment-Seat? But</p>
            <p>Ninethly: This opinion that is now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> has a very great tendancy to diſcourage and deaden the hearts of Chriſtians to the moſt noble and ſpiritual
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66517:23"/> duties of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Praiſing of God. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in God. 3. Rejoycing in God. 4. Admiring of God. 5. Taking full content and ſatisfaction in God. 6. Witneſſing for God, his Truth, his Ordinances and ways. 7. To ſelf-tryal and ſelf-examination. 8. To the making of their Calling and Election ſure. I cannot ſee with what comfort, confidence, or courage, ſuch ſouls can apply themſelves to the Eight duties laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who lye under the power of this opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins: But now when a Chriſtian is clear, and he can clear himſelf, (as every ſincere Chriſtian can) of beloved ſins, of boſom ſins, of darling ſins, how is he upon the advantage ground to fall in roundly with all the Eight duties laſt mentioned? But</p>
            <p>Tenthly and laſtly: This opinion that is now under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> conſideration, has a very great tendency to diſcourage multitudes of Chriſtians from coming to the Lords Table. I would willingly know with what comfort, with what confidence, with what hope, with what expectation of good from God, or of good from the Ordinance, can ſuch Souls draw near to the Lords Table, who lye under the power of this opinion or perſwaſion, that they carry about with them their boſom ſins, their beloved ſins, their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſins? How can ſuch ſouls expect that God ſhould meet with them in the Ordinance, and bleſs the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to them? How can ſuch ſouls expect that God ſhould make that great Ordinance to be ſtrengthening, comforting, refreſhing, eſtabliſhing and enriching unto them How can ſuch ſouls expect, that in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance God ſhould Seal up to them his Eternal Loves, their Intereſt in Chriſt, their Right to the Covenant, their Title to Heaven, and the Remiſſion of their ſins, who bring to his Table their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins? But now when the People of God draw near to the Table of the Lord, and can appeal to God; that though they have many ſinful failings and infirmities hanging upon them, yet they have no beloved
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66517:24"/> ſins, no boſom ſins, no darling ſins that they carry about with them: How comfortably and confidently may they expect that God will make that great Ordinance a bleſſing to them, and that in time all thoſe glorious ends for which that Ordinance was appointed, ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in them, and upon them? Now by theſe ten Arguments, you may ſee the weakneſs, and falſeneſs, yea, the dangerous nature of that opinion that many worthy men have ſo long Preacht, Maintained, and Printed to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I wonder that they ſhould be ſo ſadly out in this particular, when I conſider how apt men are to receive things by Tradition, without bringing of things to a ſtrict examination; and when I conſider what ſtrange definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith many famous, worthy men have given, both in their writings and Preachings; and when I conſider what a mighty noiſe many famous men have made about legal preparations, before men preſume to cloſe with Chriſt, or to give up themſelves in a Marriage Covenant to Chriſt; moſt of them requiring men to be better Chriſtians before they come to Chriſt, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they prove, after they are implanted into Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I have ſaid enough, I ſuppoſe to lay that Opinion aſleep that has been laſt under conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints have their beloved ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins; yet for a cloſe of this diſcourſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with me theſe five things.</p>
            <p>Firſt: That all Unconverted perſons have their belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſins, their boſom ſins, their darling ſins. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the boſom, the darling ſin of the <hi>Jews</hi> was Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: The beloved, the boſom, the darling ſin of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> was Uncleanneſs, Wantonneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. 20. The beloved, the boſom, the darling ſin of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> was Lying, 2 <hi>Titus 12. Jeroboams</hi> beloved ſin was Idolatry, and <hi>Cains</hi> beloved ſin was Envy, and <hi>Corahs</hi> beloved ſin was Gain ſaying, and <hi>Eſaus</hi> beloved ſin was

            <p>Thirdly: Premiſe this with me, <hi>viz.</hi> That after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there is no Sin that the heart of a Chriſtian is more ſeriouſly, more frequently, more reſolutely, and more perfectly ſet againſt, than that which was once his beloved Luſt: The hatred, deteſtation, and Indignation of a Converted perſon, breaks out and diſcovers it ſelf moſt againſt that Sin which was once a beloved Sin, a boſom Sin, a darling Sin; his care, his fear, his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, his watchfulneſs is moſt exerciſed againſt that Sin, which was once the darling of his ſoul: The Converted perſon eyes this Sin as an old Enemy; he looks upon this Sin, as the Sin by which God has been moſt diſhonoured, and his own Conſcience moſt enſlaved, and his Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul moſt indangered, and Satan moſt advantaged, and accordingly his Spirit riſes againſt it, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 8. 2. Iſa.</hi> 20. chap. 30. 22. And all Chriſtians experience confirms this truth; but of this more before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: After Converſion, a Chriſtian endeavours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to be moſt eminent in that particular grace which is moſt contrary and oppoſite to that Sin which was once his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66517:25"/> Sin, his boſom Sin, his darling Sin. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his boloved Sin was Worldlineſs and Defrauding, but being Converted, he labours to excel in reſtitution and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: The Jaylors beloved Sin was Severity &amp; Cruelty, but being Converted, he labours to excel in pitty and courteſie: <hi>Pauls</hi> beloved ſin was Perſecution, but being Converted, how mightily do's he beſtir himſelf to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſouls, and to edifie ſouls, and to build up ſouls, and to ſtrengthen ſouls, and to eſtabliſh ſouls, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſouls in the ways of the Lord; he gives it you under his own hand, <hi>That he laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 23. <hi>Auſtins</hi> beloved Sin, his boſom Sin, his darling ſin, before his Converſion, was Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Uncleanneſs; but when he was converted, he was moſt careful and watchful to arm againſt that Sin, and to avoid all temptations and occaſions that might lead him to it afterwards. If a mans beloved Sin before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion has been Wordlineſſe, then after converſion he will labour above all to excel in Heavenly-mindedneſs; or if his Sin, his beloved Sin, has been Pride, then he will labour above all to excel in Humility: or if his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sin has been intemperance, then he will labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all to excel in temperance and ſobriety; or if his beloved Sin has been Wantonneſs and Uncleanneſs, then he will labour above all, to excel in all Chaſtity and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or if his beloved Sin has been Oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſing of others, then he will labour above all, to excel in Piety and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards others; or if his beloved Sin has been Hypocriſie, then he will labour above all to excel in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Though no Godly man, though no ſincere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> gracious Chriſtian hath any beloved Sin, and boſom, darling Sin, yet there is no Godly man, there is no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere gracious ſoul, but has ſome Sin or other, to which they are more prone than to others. Every real Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath his inclination to one kind of Sin rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which may be called his ſpecial Sin, his peculiar Sin, or his own Iniquity, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66517:25"/> ver. 23. Now the main power of grace and of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is mainly ſeen and exerciſed in a mans keeping of himſelf from his Iniquity. Now that ſpecal, that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Sin, to which a gracious ſoul may be moſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one and addicted to, may ariſe, 1. From the temperament and conſtitution of his body; the complexion and conſtitution of a mans body may be a more prepared inſtrument for one vice rather than another: or 2. It may ariſe from his particular Calling; Chriſtians have diſtinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings that encline them to particular Sins. For inſtance, the Souldiers Calling puts him upon Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and Violence, <hi>Luk. 3. 14. Do Violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſly, and be content with your wages.</hi> And the Trades-mans Calling, puts him upon Lying, Deceiving, Defrauding, and over-reaching his Brother. And the Miniſters Calling puts him upon Flattering of the Gallants and great ones of his Pariſh, and upon pleaſing the reſt, by ſpeaking of ſmooth things, <hi>Iſa. 30. 10. and by ſowing of Pillows under their Elbows, Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k.</hi> 13. 18, 20. And the Magiſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lays them open to Oppreſſion, Bribery, Injuſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Chriſtians are not very much upon their watch, their very Callings and Offices may prove a very great ſnare to their ſouls: Or 3dly, It may ariſe from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate &amp; condition in this world, whether his ſtate be a ſtate of Proſperity, or a ſtate of Adverſity; or whether he be in a Marriage ſtate, or in a ſingle ſtate. Many times a mans outward ſtate and condition in this world, hath a ſtrong influence upon him, to encline him to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that particular ſin, as beſt ſuiting with his condition: or 4thly, It may ariſe from diſtinct and peculiar Ages; for it is certain, that diſtinct and peculiar Ages do ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encline perſons to diſtinct and peculiar Sins; Youth enclines to Wantonneſs and Prodigality; and Manhood, to Pride, and Ambition; and Old Age, to Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Frowardneſs. Common experience tells us, that many times Wantonneſs is the Sinners darling in the time of his youth, and Worldlineſs his darling in the time
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66517:26"/> of his age; and without controverſie, Chriſtians diſtinct and peculiar Ages may more ſtrongly incline them to this or that Sin, rather than any other: or 5thly, It may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from that diſtinct and particular way of Breeding and Education which he has had. Now to arm ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt their ſpecial Sins, their peculiar ſins (whoſe Sins are advantaged againſt them, either by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and complexion, or elſe by their particular Calling, or elſe by their outward ſtate and condition, or elſe by their diſtinct and peculiar ages, or elſe by their particular way of Breeding and Education) is my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work and buſineſs; for though the raigning power of this, or that ſpecial peculiar Sin be broken in a mans Converſion, yet the remaining life and ſtrength that is ſtill left in thoſe corruptions, will by Satan be improved againſt the growth, peace, comfort, and aſſurance of the ſoul: Satan will ſtrive to enter in at the ſame door, and by the ſame Dalilah, by which he hath betrayed and wounded the ſoul, he will do all he can to do the ſoul a further miſchief; Satan will be ſtill a reminding of the ſoul of thoſe former ſweets, pleaſures, profits, delights, and contents that have come in upon the old ſcore; ſo that it will be a hard thing, even for a Godly man to keep himſelf from his Iniquity, from his ſpecial or peculiar Sin, which the Fathers commonly call, (though not truly) <hi>peccatum in delitiis,</hi> a mans ſpecial darlin and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sin. Well Chriſtians, remember this once for all, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſound Converſion includes a noble and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious revenge upon that Sin which was once a mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, boſom, darling Sin, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 11. Yea, what clearing of your ſelves; yea, what Indignation; yea, what fear; yea, what vchement deſire; yea, what zeal; yea, what revenge.</hi> You ſee this in <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who when he had ſubſcribed with his right hand, to that which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience, he afterwards, as a holy revenge, put that right hand into the flames; ſo <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> takes that hair of hers. Of all Sins; (ſaith the ſound Convert) I am reſolved to be avenged on my once
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66517:26"/> beloved, boſom, darling Sins, by which I have moſt diſhonoured God, and wronged my own precious and immortal ſoul, and by which I have moſt endangered my everlaſting Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared up my way, I ſhall now endeavour to lay before you ſome ſpecial remedies, means, or helps againſt cheriſhing or keeping up of any ſpecial or peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Sin, either in heart, or life, againſt the Lord, or againſt the light and conviction of a mans own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Cherriſhing or keeping up of any ſpecial or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sin, either in heart or life againſt the Lord, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light and conviction of a mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will hinder aſſurance theſe ſeveral ways:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It will abate the degrees of our Graces, and ſo make them more undiſcernable. Now grace rather in its degrees, than in its ſincerity, or ſimple being only, is that which gives the cleareſt evidence of a gracious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or of a mans intereſt in Chriſt. Sin, lived in, is like a Vermin to the Tree, which deſtroys the fruit; Grace cannot thrive in a ſinful heart: In ſome ſoyl, Plants will not grow: The cherriſhing of Sin, is the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Grace: The caſting of a favourable eye on any one ſpecial Sin, hinders the growth of Grace: If a man has a choyce Plant or Flower in his Garden, and it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſhrevils, and is dying, he opens the ground, and looks at the root, and there finds a Worm gnawing the root; and this is the cauſe of the Flowers fading: the Application is eaſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly: The cherriſhing of any ſpecial peculiar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sin, or the keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, and againſt the light of a mans own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will hinder the lively actings and exerciſe of grace, it will keep Grace at an under, ſo that it will hardly be ſeen to ſtir or act; yea, it will keep Grace ſo down, that it will hardly be heard to ſpeak. When a ſpecial, or peculiar Sin is entertained, it will exceedingly mar the vigorous exerciſes of thoſe graces which are the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66517:27"/> of a lively Faith, and of a gracious ſtate, and of a mans Intereſt in Chriſt: Grace is never apparent and ſenſible to the ſoul, but while it is in action; therefore want of action muſt needs cauſe want of aſſurance. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are not felt immediately, but by the freeneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of their acts, of the very being of the ſoul it ſelf, nothing is felt or perceived, but only its acts. The fire that ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th ſtill in the flint, is neither ſeen nor felt; but when you ſmite it, and force it into act, it is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable. For the moſt part, ſo long as a Chriſtian hath his graces in lively action, ſo long he is aſſured of them: He that would be aſſured that this ſacred fire of grace is in his heart, he muſt blow it up, and get it into a flame. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: The cherriſhing of any ſpecial Sin, or the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion (in heart or life) againſt the Lord, and againſt the light of a mans own Conſcience, ſo blears, dimms, and darkens the eye of the ſoul, that it cannot ſee its own condition, nor have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clear knowledge of its gracious ſtate, or of its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Somtimes men in riding, raiſe ſuch a duſt, that they can neither ſee themſelves, nor their deareſt Friends, ſo as to diſtinguiſh one from another; the Application is eaſie. The Room ſomtimes is ſo full of ſmoak, that a man cannot ſee the Jewels, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that lyes before him; ſo 'tis here. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: Cherriſhing of any ſpecial or peculiar Sin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or the keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, or againſt the light of a mans own Conſcience, provokes the Lord to withdraw himſelf, his comforts, and the gracious preſence and aſſiſtance of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; without which preſence and aſſiſtance the ſoul may ſearch and ſeek long enough for aſſurance, comfort, and a ſight of a mans intereſt in Chriſt, before it will enjoy the one, or ſee the other. If by keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, you ſet the holy Spirit a mourning, which alone can comfort you, and aſſure you of your intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>You may walk long en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>comfort and aſſurance,</hi> Lam. 1. 16. <hi>The Comforter that ſhould relieve my Soul, is far from me;</hi> ſo in that 1 John 3. 21. It is ſuppoſed, that a ſelf-condemning heart, makes void a mans Confidence before God. The preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel of Faith can be holden in no other place, but in a pure Conſcience, that is the only Royal Palace, wherein it muſt and will dwell, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 19. Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> He that comes to God with a true, honeſt, upright heart, being ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, may draw near to God in full aſſurance of Faith; whereas guilt, clouds, clogs, and diſtracts the ſoul, that it can never be with God, either as it would, or as it ſhould; <hi>Conſcientia pura, ſemper ſecura,</hi> A good Conſcience hath ſure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Conſcience is <hi>mille teſtes,</hi> a thouſand Witneſſes for, or againſt a man. Conſcience is Gods Preacher in the boſom. 'Tis better with <hi>Euagrius</hi> to lye ſecure on a bed of Straw, than to have a turbulent Conſcience on a bed of Down. It was a Divine ſaying of <hi>(Seneca)</hi> a Heathen, <hi>viz.</hi> That if there were no God to puniſh him, no Devil to torment him, no Hell to burn him, no man to ſee him; yet would he not ſin, for the uglineſs of ſin, and the grief of his own Conſcience. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Cherriſhing of any ſpecial or peculiar ſin, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion (in heart or life) againſt the Lord, and againſt the light of a mans own Conſcience, will greatly hinder his high eſteem and reputation of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it will keep him from comfort, aſſurance, and ſight of his intereſt in him; ſo that ſomtimes his deareſt Children are conſtrained to cry out, <hi>God is departed from me, and he anſwereth me not, neither by Dream, nor Viſion, neither this way, nor that,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 15. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: The greateſt and moſt common cauſe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".6"/> want of aſſurance, comfort and peace, is ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Luſt, ſome ſecret, ſpecial, peculiar ſin, unto
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66517:28"/> which men give entertainment, or at leaſt, which they do not ſo vigorouſly oppoſe, and heartily renounce as they ſhould and might, <hi>hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> and this is that which caſts them on ſore ſtraits and difficulties; and how ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſeeing God, who is infinitely wiſe, holy, and righteous, either cannot, or will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the ſecrets of his love to thoſe who harbour his known Enemies in their boſoms? the great God either cannot, or will not regard the whinings and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe who play or dally with that very ſin which gauls their Conſciences, and connive and wink at the ſtirrings and workings of that very Luſt, for which he hides his face from them, and writes bitter things againſt them. Mark, all fears, and doubts, and ſcruples, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten upon ſin, either real, or imaginary: Now if the ſin be but imaginary, an enlightned rectified judgment, may eaſily and quickly ſcatter ſuch fears, doubts, and ſcruples as the Sun doth miſts, and clouds, when it ſhines in its brightneſs; but if the Sin be real, then there is no poſſibility of curing thoſe fears, doubts, and ſcruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from thence, but by an unfained Repentance, and returning from that ſin. Now if I ſhould produce all the Scriptures and inſtances that ſtand ready preſt to prove this, I muſt tranſcribe a good part of the Bible; but this would be labour in vain, ſeeing it ſeemeth to have been a notion, engraven even on natural Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſin ſo defiles perſons, that till they be waſhed from it, neither they, nor their ſervices can be accepted; from whence aroſe that cuſtom of ſetting water-pots at their entrance into their Temples, or places of worſhip. Let him that wants aſſurance, comfort, peace, and a ſight of his intereſt in Chriſt, caſt out every known ſin, and ſet upon a univerſal courſe of Reformation; for God will not give his Cordials to thoſe that have a foul Stomack; thoſe, that againſt light, and checks of Conſcience, dally and tamper with this ſin, or that, thoſe God will have no commerce, no communion with; on ſuch, God will not lift up the light of his countenance, <hi>Rev. 2. 17. To him</hi>

               <hi>that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white ſtone, and in that ſtone, a new name written.</hi> Theſe are all Metaphorical expreſſions, which being put together, do amount to as much as Aſſurance; but mark, theſe are promiſed. <gap reason="foreign">

O that Chriſtians would ſeriouſly remember this The dearer it coſt any one to part with his ſins, the more ſweet and comfortable will it be to call to mind the Victory, that through the ſpirit of grace he has got over his ſins. There is no comfort, joy, or peace to that which ariſes from the conqueſts of ſin, eſpecially of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſins. When <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlain, what joy and triumph was there in the Camp? So here,</p>
            <p>Seventhly: Cherriſhing of any ſpecial or peculiar ſin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> or the keeping up of any known tranſgreſſion (either in heart or life) againſt the Lord, and againſt the light of a mans own Conſcience, will hinder the ſoul from that warm, lively, fervent, frequent, ſeaſonable, ſincere, and conſtant way of duty, as contributes moſt to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace, peace, comfort, and aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly: Seriouſly conſider of the ſeveral aſſertions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and concurrent judgments of our beſt and moſt famous Divines in the preſent caſe: I ſhall give you a taſt of ſome of their Sayings.</p>
            <p>Firſt: A man (ſaith one) can have no peace in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conſcience, that favoureth and retaineth any one ſin in himſelf againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Another ſaith, A man is in a damnable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtate, whatſoever good deeds ſeem to be in him, if he yield not to the work of the Holy Ghoſt, for the leaving but of any one known ſin which fighteth againſt peace of Conſcience. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: So long (ſaith another) as the power of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> mortification deſtroyeth thy ſinful affections; and ſo long as thou art unfainedly diſpleaſed with all ſin; and doeſt mortifie the deeds of the body by the Spirit, thy caſe is the caſe of Salvation. But</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66517:29"/>
            <p>Fourthly: Another ſaith, A good Conſcience ſtands not with a purpoſe of ſinning, no not with irreſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin; this muſt be underſtood of habitual purpoſes, and of a conſtant irreſolution againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: The rich and precious box of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> (ſaith another) is polluted and made impure, if but one dead fly be ſuffered in it. One ſin being quietly permitted, and ſuffered to live in the ſoul, without be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing diſturbed, reſiſted, reſolved againſt, or lamented o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will certainly mar the peace of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: Where there is but any one ſin (ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".6"/> nouriſhed and foſtered, all other our graces are not only blemiſhed, but aboliſhed, they are no graces; <hi>Dike, of the deceiptfulneſs of the heat,</hi> chap. 16.</p>
            <p>Seventhly: Moſt true is that ſaying of <hi>Aquinus,</hi> That all ſins are coupled together, though not in regard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to temporal good, for ſome look to the good of gain, ſome of glory, ſome of pleaſure; yet in regard of averſion from eternal good, that is God: So that he that looks but towards one ſin, is as much averted and turned back from God, as if he looked to all; in which reſpect St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>He that off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndeth in one, is guilty of all,</hi> 2 Jam. 10. Now that ye may not miſtake <hi>Aquinas,</hi> nor the Scripture he cites, you muſt remember that the whole Law is but one copulative, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12, 13. v Mark, he that breaketh one Command, habitually breaketh all; not ſo actually. Such as are truly Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, in reſpect of the habitual deſires, purpoſes, bents, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes, inclinations, reſolutions, and endeavours of their Souls, do keep thoſe very commands that actually they daily break. But a diſpenſatory Conſcience keeps not any one Commandement of God; he that willingly and wilfully, and habitually gives himſelf liberty to break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Commandement, is guilty of all: That is 1. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he breaks the chain of duties, and ſo breaks all the Law, being copulative; or, 2. With the ſame diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, that he willingly, wilfully, habitually breaks
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66517:29"/> one, with the ſame diſpoſition of heart he is ready preſt to break all. The Apoſtles meaning in that, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. is certainly this, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuppoſe a man ſhould keep the whole Law for ſubſtance, except in ſome one particular; yet by allowing of himſelf in this particular, thereby he manifeſts that he kept no precept of the Law in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and conſcience unto God; for if he did, then he would be careful to keep every precept: thus much the words following import, and hereby he manifeſts that he is guilty of all. Some others conceive, that therefore ſuch a one may be ſaid to be guilty of all, becauſe by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of himſelf in any one ſin, thereby he lyes under that Curſe which is threatned againſt the tranſgreſſors of the Law, <hi>Dan.</hi> 27. 26.</p>
            <p>Eighthly: Every Chriſtian ſhould carry in his heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> (ſaith another) a conſtant and reſolute purpoſe not to ſin in any thing; for Faith and the purpoſe of ſinning can never ſtand together: This muſt be underſtood of an habitual, not actual; of a conſtant, not tranſient pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: But</p>
            <p>Ninethly: One flaw in a Diamond (ſaith another) takes away the luſtre and the price. One puddle, if we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> wallow in it, will defile us. One man, in Law, may keep Poſſeſſion.

            <p>Tenthly: One turn may bring a man quite out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> way. One act of Treaſon makes a Traytor. <hi>Giddcon</hi> had ſeventy Sons, but one Baſtard, and yet that one Baſtard deſtroyed all the reſt, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 13.

            <p>Fourteenthly: Satan can be content that men ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> yield to God in many things, provided that they will be but true to him in ſome one thing; for he knows very well, that as one dram of Poyſon may poyſon a man; and one ſtab at the heart may kill a man; ſo one ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, one ſin allowed, retained, cherriſhed, and practiſed, will certainly damn a man.

            <p>Twentiethly: The keeping up of any known tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> againſt the Lord, may endanger the ſouls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and may be found a fighting againſt all the crys, prayers, tears, promiſes, Vows, and Covenants that thou haſt made to God, when thou haſt been upon a ſick bed, or in eminent dangers, or near death; or elſe when thou haſt been in ſolemn ſeeking of the Lord, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or with others; theſe things ſhould be frequently and ſeriouſly thought of by ſuch poor ſouls as are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by any Luſt.</p>

Pray where do you find in any of the bleſſed Scriptures, that any of the Patriarks, Prophets, Apoſtles, or Saints, are ever charged with a willing, or a wilfull keeping up either in their hearts, or lives, any known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>Twenty-three: The keeping up of any known tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> againſt the Lord, will highly make againſt all clear, ſweet, and ſtanding communion with God.

            <p>Twenty-four: The keeping up, either in heart or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> life, of any known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, will fight againſt the ſtanding joy, peace, comfort, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſoul.

I ſhall conclude this particular with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66517:31"/> a notable ſaying of one of the Ancients. The joys of a good Conſcience are the Paradiſe of Souls, the delight of Angels, the Garden of delights, the Field of bleſſing, the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Court of God, the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit: <hi>Bernard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twenty-five: The keeping up of any known tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> either in heart or life againſt the Lord, is a high contempt of the All ſeeing Eye of God, of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of God. It is well known what <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> that great Monarch ſaid concerning <hi>Haman,</hi> when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, he found him caſt upon the Queens bed, on which ſhe ſate; <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will he force the Queen before me, in the houſe,</hi> Eſth. 7. 8.

The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 9. There is no drawing of a Curtain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thee. God is <hi>totus Oculus,</hi> all Eye; He ſeeth all things, in all places, and at all times. When
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66517:32"/> thou art in ſecret, conſider Conſcience is preſent, which is more than a thouſand Witneſſes; and God is preſent, which is more than a thouſand Conſciences. It was a pretty fancy of one that would have his Chamber painted full of eyes, that which way ſoever he lookt, he might ſtill have ſome eyes upon him; and he fancying himſelf according to the Moraliſts advice, always under the eye of a Keeper, might be the more careful of his carriage. O! Sirs, if the eyes of men, makes even the vileſt to forbear their beloved luſts for a while; that the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer watcheth for the twy-light; and they that are Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, are Drunken in the Night. How powerful will the Eye and Preſence of God be with thoſe that fear His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and know the ſweetneſs of his Favour? The thought of this Omnipreſence of God will affrighten thee from ſin. <hi>Gehezi</hi> durſt not ask, or receive any part of <hi>Nahamans</hi> Preſents in his Maſters preſence, but when he had got out of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſight, then he tells his Lye, and gives way to his Luſts. Men never ſin more freely, then when they preſume upon ſecrecy; <hi>They break in pieces thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple O Lord, and afflict thy Heritage. They ſlay the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Stranger, and murder the Fatherleſs,</hi> yet they ſay, <hi>The Lord doth not ſee, neither ſhall the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it,</hi> Pſal. 94. 5, 6, 7. They, who abounded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſeeth us not, the Lord hath forſaken the Earth,</hi> Ezek. 8, 9, 12. The wiſe man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth from wickedneſs upon the conſideration of Gods Eye and Omniſcience. <hi>And why wilt thou my Son be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with a ſtrange Woman, and embrace the boſom of a Stranger; for the ways of man are before the Eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings,</hi> Proverbs 5. 20, 21. Joſeph <hi>ſaw God in the Room, and therefore durſt not yield; but his Miſtreſs ſaw none but</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and ſo was impudently alluring and tempting him to folly.</hi> I have read of two Religious men that took contrary courſes with two lewd Women, whom they were deſirous to reclaim from their Vicious courſe of life: One of the Men, told one of the Women, that he was deſirous to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66517:32"/> enjoy her Company, ſo it might be with ſecrecy; and when ſhe had brought him into a cloſe room, that none could pry into, he told her, <hi>All the barrs and bolts here cannot keep God out.</hi> The other deſired the other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to company with him, openly in the ſtreets, which when ſhe rejected as a mad requeſt; he told her, <hi>It was better to do it in the eyes of a multitude, than in the eyes of God.</hi> O why ſhall not the preſence of that God, who hates ſin, and who is reſolved to puniſh it with Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames, make us aſhamed or afraid to ſin, and dare him to his face.</p>
            <p>Twenty-ſix: There have been many a Prodigal, who by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> one caſt of the Dice, have loſt a fair Inheritance. A man may be kill'd with one ſtab of a Pen-knife; and one hole in a Ship may ſink it: and one Thief may rob a man of all he has in the world. A man may eſcape many groſs ſins, and yet by living in the allowance of ſome one ſin, be deprived of the glory of Heaven for ever. <hi>Moſes</hi> came within the ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but for one ſin, not ſanctifying Gods Name, he was ſhut out; and no leſs will it be to any man, that for living in any one ſin, ſhall be for ever ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven; not but that there may be ſome remainders of ſin, and yet the heart taken off from every ſin: but if there be any ſecret cloſing with any one way of ſin, all the profeſſion of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and leaving all other ſins, will be to no purpoſe, nor ever bring a man to happineſs.</p>
            <p>Twenty-ſeaven: As the Philoſopher ſaith, a Cup, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> ſome ſuch thing that hath a hole in it, is no Cup, it will hold nothing, and therefore cannot perform the uſe of a cup, though it have but one hole in it. So if the heart have but one hole in it, if it retain the Devil but in one thing, if it make choyce but of any one ſin, to lie and wallow in, and tumble in, it doth evacuate all the other good by the entertainment of that one ſin; the whole box of Oyntment will be ſpoyled by the dropping of that one Flye into it. By the Laws of our Kingdom, a man can never have a true Poſſeſſion, till he have voided all. And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66517:33"/> in the ſtate of grace, no man can have a full intereſt in Chriſt, till all ſin, that is, all reigning, domineering ſin be rooted out.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the concurrant judgments of our moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divines, againſt mens allowing, indulging, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any one known ſin againſt their light and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; but that theſe Sayings of theirs may lay in more weight and power upon every poor ſoul that is intangled with any baſe Luſts; be pleaſed ſeriouſly and frequently to conſider of theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: 'Tis to no purpoſe for a man to turn from ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſins, if he do's not turn from all his ſins, <hi>Jam. 1. 26. If any man ſeem to be Religious, and bridle not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is in vain.</hi> This at firſt ſight may ſeem to be a hard ſaying, that for one fault, for one fault in the tongue, all a mans Religion ſhould be counted vain; and yet this you ſee the Holy-Ghoſt does peremptorily conclude. Let a man make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo glorious a profeſſion of Religion, yet if he gives himſelf liberty to live in the practiſe of any known ſin, yea, though it be but in a ſin of the tongue, his Religion is in vain, and that one ſin will ſeparate him from God for ever. If a Wife be never ſo officious to her Husband in many things, yet if ſhe entertains any other Lover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bed beſides himſelf, it will for ever alienate his affections from her, and make an everlaſting ſeparation between them: The Application is eaſie, to turn from one ſin to another, is but to be toſſed from one hand of the Devil to another; it is but with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of one diſeaſe, and die of another; It is but to take pains to go to Hell. If a Ship ſpring three leaks, and only two be ſtopped, the third will ſink the Ship; or if a man have two grievous wounds in his body, and takes order only to cure one, that which is neglected will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly kill him. 'Tis ſo here. <hi>Herod, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> with the Scribes and Phariſees, have for many hundred years experienced this truth. But</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:66517:33"/>
            <p>Secondly: Partial obedience, is indeed no obedience, it is only univerſal obedience, that is true obedience, <hi>Exod. 24. 7. All that the Lord hath ſaid, will we do, and be obedient.</hi> They only are indeed obedient, who have a care to do all that is commanded: For to obey, is to do that which is commanded, becauſe it is commanded; though the thing done be commanded, yet if it be not therefore done, becauſe it is commanded, it is no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Now if this be the nature of obedience, then where obedience is indeed, it is not partial but univerſal; for he that doth any one thing that is commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commanded, he will be carefull to doe every thing that is commanded, there being the ſame reaſon for all. They that are only for a partial obedience, they do break a ſunder the bond and reaſon of all obedience; for all obedience is to be founded upon the Authority and will of God, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od (who hath Authority over all his Creatures) doth will and command us to obey his voyce, to walk in his Statutes; for this very reaſon do we ſtand bound to obey him; and if we do obey him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reaſon, then muſt we walk in all his Statutes, for ſo hath he commanded us; and if we will not come up to this, but will walk in what Statutes of his we pleaſe, then do we renounce his Will, as the obliging reaſon of our obedience, and do ſet up our own liking and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as the reaſon thereof. God has ſo connexed the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Law one to another, that if there be not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious care to walk according to all that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, a man becomes a tranſgreſſor of the whole Law, according to that of Saint <hi>James, chap.</hi> 2. 10. whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all, the bond of all is broken, the Authority of all is ſlighted, and that evil diſpoſition, that ſinful frame of heart, that works a man to venture upon the breach of one command, would make him venture upon the breach of any command, were it not for ſome infirmity of nature, or becauſe his purſe will not hold out to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, or for ſhame, or loſs, or becauſe of the eyes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66517:34"/> Friends, or the ſword of the Magiſtrate, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſiniſter reſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts. He that gives himſelf liberty to live in the breach of any one command of God, is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a diſpoſition of heart to break them all. Every ſingle ſin contains vertually all ſin in it. He that allows himſelf a liberty to live in the breach of any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Law of God, he caſts contempt and ſcorn upon the Authority that made the whole Law, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count breaks it all. And the Apoſtle gives the reaſon of it in <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> 11. For he that ſaid, <hi>Do not commit Adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Do not k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll:</hi> Now if thou commit no Adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law, not that he is guilty of all diſtributively, but collectively; for the Law is copulative, there is a chain of duties, and theſe are all ſo likned one to another, that you cannot break one link of the chain, but you break the whole chain. No man can live in the breach of any of any known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, but he wrongs every command of God, he hath no real regard to any of the Commandements of God, that hath not a regard to all the Commandements of God. There is one and the ſame Law-giver in reſpect of all the Commandements, he that gave one command, gave alſo another; therefore he that obſerves one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in obedience unto God, whoſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, he will obſerve all, becauſe all are his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and he that ſlights one Commandement, is guilty of all, becauſe he doth contemn the Authority of him that gave them all. Even in thoſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he doth obſerve, he hath no reſpect to the Will and Authority of him that gave them; therefore as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth well obſerve upon <hi>Jam. 2. 10, 11. That there is no Obedience towards God, where there is not an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form endeavour to pleaſe God, as well in one thing as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: Partial obedience tends to plain Atheiſme; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for by the ſame reaſon that you ſlight the Will of God in any Commandement, by the ſame reaſon you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his Will in every Commandement; for every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66517:34"/> of God is his Will, and it is <hi>holy, ſpiritual, juſt, and good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12, 14. and contrary to our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts; and if this be the reaſon why ſuch and ſuch Commandements of God wont down with you, then by the ſame reaſon none of them muſt be of Authority with you.</p>

            <p>Fifthly: Partial Obedience is an audacious charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelf, as to his Wiſdom, or Power, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Goodneſs; for thoſe Statutes of God which you will not come up unto, either they are as Righteous as the reſt, and as Holy as the reſt, and as Spiritual as the reſt, and as Good as the reſt, or they are not: If they be as holy, ſpiritual, juſt, righteous, and good as the reſt, why ſhould you not walk in them, as well as in the reſt? To ſay they are not as holy, ſpiritual, righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the reſt, O what a Blaſphemous charge is this againſt God himſelf, in preſcribing unto him any thing that is not righteous and good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and likewiſe in making his will, (which is the rule of all righteouſneſs and goodneſs) to be partly righteous, and partly unrighteous; to be partly good, and partly bad.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: God delights in univerſal Obedience, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> thoſe that perform it, <hi>Deut. 5. 29. O that there were ſuch a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandements always;</hi> upon this account <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the friend of God in Scripture, three times, <hi>Iſa. 41. 8. 2 Chron. 20. 7. James</hi> 2. 3. and upon the very ſame account, God called <hi>David, A man after his own heart,</hi> Act. 13. 22. <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>a man after mine own heart, which ſhall fulfill all my Will.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All my wills, to note the univerſality and ſincerity of his Obedience.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:66517:35"/>
            <p>Seventhly: There is not any one Statute of God, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> it is good, and for our good, <hi>ergo,</hi> we ſhould walk in all his Statutes, <hi>Deut. 5. 25. Ye ſhall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you;</hi> that you may live, and that it may be well with you; what one path hath, the Lord commanded us to walk in, but as it concerns his own glory, ſo likewiſe it concerns our good?</p>
            <p>Is it not good for us to love the Lord, and to ſet him up as the object of our fear, and to act faith on him, and to worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, and to be tender of his glory, and to ſanctifie his day, and to keep off from ſin, and to keep cloſe to his ways. But</p>
            <p>Eighthly: Univerſal Obedience, is the condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> which the promiſe of mercy and ſalvation runs, <hi>Ezek. 18. 21. If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all his Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninethly: Our hearts muſt be perfect with the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> our God, <hi>Deut. 18. 13. Thou ſhalt be perfect with the Lord thy God,</hi> and Gen. 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Now how can our hearts be ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with God, if we do prevaricate with him; if in ſome things we obey him, and in other things we will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; if we walk in ſome of his Statutes, but will not walk in all his Statutes; if in ſome part we will be his Servants, and in other part of our lives, we will be the Servants of ſin. But</p>
            <p>Tenthly: If the heart be found, and up-right, it will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> yeeld entire and univerſal Obedience, <hi>Pſal. 119. 80. Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, that I may not be a ſhamed,</hi> and v. 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect to all thy Commandements;</hi> by theſe verſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, it appears, that then the heart is ſound and ſincere, when a man has reſpect unto all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: without a univerſal Obedience, a man can never have that hope which maketh not aſhamed. But</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66517:35"/>
            <p>Eleventhly: Either we muſt endeavour to walk in all the Statutes of God, or elſe we muſt find ſome diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or toleration from God to free us, and excuſe us, and hold us indemnified, though we do not walk in all of them. Now what one Commandement is there from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereunto God excuſeth any man? or will not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> puniſh him for the neglect of obedience unto it: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2. 10. If he prevaricates with God, as to any one particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his, his heart is naught, he is guilty of all, he hath really no regard of any of the reſt of Gods Laws. But</p>
            <p>12thly: The precious Saints and Servants of God, whoſe examples are recorded, and ſet forth for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they have been very careful to perform univerſal Obedience; will you ſee it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was ready to comply with God in all his Royal Commands. When <hi>God commanded him to leave his Country, and his Fathers Houſe, he did it,</hi> Gen. 12. <hi>When God Commanded him to be Circumciſed, though it were both ſhameful and painful, he ſubmitted unto it,</hi> Gen. 17. <hi>When God commanded him to ſend away his Son</hi> Iſhmael, though when <hi>Sarah</hi> ſpeak to him about it, the things feemed very grievious unto him, yet as ſoon as he ſaw it to be the Will of God, he was Obedient unto it, <hi>Gen. 21. When God commanded him to Sacrifice his Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>his only Son, the Son of his Old age, the Son of the Promiſe, the Son of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elight;</hi> yea, that Son from whom was to proceed, that Jeſus in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed; and though all this might ſeem to croſs both Nature and Grace, both Reaſon and Religion, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to obey God in this alſo, and to do what he commanded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. ſo <hi>David was a man after Gods own heart,</hi> which fulfilled all his Wills, as the original runs in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 22. And it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they walked in all the Commandements and Ordinances of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Luk. 1. 6. 1 Theſ. 2. 10. Ye are Witneſſes, and God alſo,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:66517:36"/> 
               <hi>how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably we behaved our ſelves among you that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13thly: Univerſal Obedience ſpeaks out the ſtrength of our love to Chriſt, and the reality of our friendſhip <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> with Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 15. 14. Ye are my Friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you.</hi> That Child ſhews moſt love to his Father, that obſerves all his precepts; and that Servant ſhews moſt love to his Maſter, that obſerves all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters commands, and that Wife ſhews moſt love to her Husband, that obſerves all he requires in the Lord: So here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14thly. Univerſal Obedience will give moſt peace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> reſt, quiet, and comfort to the Conſcience. Such a Chriſtian will be as an eye that hath no Mote to trouble it; as a Kingdom that hath no Rebel to annoy it; as a Ship that hath no leak to diſturb it, <hi>Pſal. 119. 165. Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them.</hi> But</p>
            <p>15thly: Mans holineſs muſt be conformable to Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Holineſs, <hi>Ephe. 5. 1, 2. Be ye followers of God as dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Math. 5. 48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> Now God is Righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, and ſo ought all to deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be, that would be ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 15. As he who hath called you is Holy, ſo be ye alſo holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> v. 16. becauſe it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> But</p>
            <p>16thly. The holineſs of a Chriſtian muſt be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> to the holineſs of Chriſt. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1. Now Chriſt was holy in all things. <hi>It behoveth us</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to fulfill all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And this ſhould be the care of every one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf to be Chriſts, <hi>to endeavour to be holy as Chriſt was holy,</hi> 1 John 2. 6. He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf to walk even as he walked. But</p>
            <p>17thly. Servants muſt obey their earthly Maſters, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> in ſome things only, but in all things, to wit, that are juſt and lawful, <hi>Tit. 2. 9. Exhort Servants to be obedient to</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:66517:36"/> 
               <hi>their own Maſters, and to pleaſe them well in all things.</hi> What Maſter will be content that his Servant ſhould chuſe how far forth he will obſerve and do thoſe things which he doth require of him? much leſs may we think that ſuch arbitrary and partial performances will pleaſe that God who is our Heavenly Maſter.</p>
            <p>18thly: The promiſes of mercy, both ſpiritual and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> temporal, are made over to univerſal obedience, 1 <hi>King. 6. 12, 13. Deut. 28. 1, 2, 3, Ezek.</hi> 18. 21, 22, 27, 28. turn to all theſe promiſes and dilate on them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19thly. One ſin never goes alone, as you may ſee in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> the falls of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, Lot, Abraham, Noah, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Joſeph, Job, David, Solomon, Peter, Ahab, Judas, Jeroboam;</hi> one ſin will make way for more; as one little Thief can open the door to let in many great ones: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will be ſure to neſt himſelf, to lodge himſelf in the leaſt ſins, (as Birds neſt &amp; lodge themſelves in the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt branches of the Tree) and there he will do all he can to hatch all manner of wickedneſs. A little wedge makes way for a greater; &amp; ſo do little ſins make way for greater.</p>
            <p>20. The reaſons of turning from ſin, are univerſally binding to a gracious ſoul. There are the ſame reaſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and grounds for a penitent man's turning from every ſin, as there is for his turning from any one ſin; do you turn from this or that ſin, becauſe the Lord hath forbid it? why, upon the ſame ground you muſt turn from every ſin; for God has forbid every ſin as well as this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin; there is the ſame Authority forbidding or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in all; and if the Authority of God awes a man from one ſin, it will awe him from all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>21ſtly One ſin allowed, and lived in, will keep Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> and the Soul a-ſunder. As one Rebel, one Traytor, hid and kept in the Houſe, will keep a Prince and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a-ſunder; or as one ſtone in the Pipe, will keep the water and the Ciſtern a-ſunder. So here. But</p>
            <p>22dly. One ſin allowed, and lived in, will unfit a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> for ſuffering; as one cut, or one ſhot in the ſhoulder, may hinder a man from bearing a burden; will he ever
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66517:37"/> lay down his life for Chriſt that can't, that won't lay down a Luſt for Chriſt. But</p>
            <p>23dly. One ſin allowed and lived in, is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> a man for ever of the greateſt good. One ſin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and wallowed in, will as certainly deprive a man o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>f the bleſſed Viſion of God, and of all the treaſures, pleaſures, and delights that be at God's right hand, as a thouſand. One ſin ſtript the fallen Angels of all their glory; and one ſin ſtript our firſt Parents of all their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and excellency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5. One flye in the box of prccious Oyntment, ſpoyls the whole box: One Thief may Rob a man of all his treaſure; one Diſeaſe may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a man of all his health; and one drop of Poyſon will ſpoyl the whole glaſs of Wine: and ſo one Sin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and lived in, will make a man miſerable for ever. One Mill ſtone will ſink a man to the bottom of the Sea, as well as a hundred: 'tis ſo here. But</p>
            <p>24thly. One Sin allowed, and lived in, will eat out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> all peace of Conſcience; as one ſtring that jars, Will ſpoyl the ſweeteſt Muſick; ſo one ſin countenanced and lived in, will ſpoyl the muſick of Conſcience. One Pyrate may Rob a man of all he has in this world. But</p>
            <p>25thly. and laſtly: The Sinner would have God to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> forgive him, not only ſome of his ſins, but all his ſins; and therefore 'tis but juſt and equal that he ſhould turn from all his ſins. If God be ſo faithful and juſt to forgive us all our ſins, we muſt be ſo faithful and juſt as to turn from all our ſins. The Plaiſter muſt be as broad as the Sore, and the Tent as long, and as deep as the Wound. It argues horrid Hypocriſie, damnable folly, and wonderful impudency, for a man to beg the pardon of thoſe very ſins that he is reſolved never to forſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it is impoſſible for any man on Earth to walk in all God's Statutes, to obey all his Commands, to do his will in all things, to walk according to the full bredth of Gods Royal Law. <hi>Sol.</hi> I Anſwer, there is a two-fold walking in all the Statutes of God; there is a two-fold Obedience to all the Royal Commands of God.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:66517:37"/>
            <p>Firſt: One is legal, when all is done that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and all is done as God requireth, when there is not one path of duty, but we do walk in it perfectly and continually: thus no man on Earth doth, or can walk in all God's Statutes, or fully do what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth; <hi>For in many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. So <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 20. There is not a juſt man upon the Earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> 1 King. 8. 46. <hi>For there is no man that ſinneth not,</hi> Prov. 20. 9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin,</hi> Job. 14. 4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, not one,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8. If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Another is Evangelical, which is ſuch a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> walking in all the Statutes of God, and ſuch a keeping of all the Commands of God, as is in Chriſt accepted of, and accounted of, as if we did keep them all; (this walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all God's Statutes, and keeping of all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and doing of them all, is not only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it is alſo actual in every Believer, in every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian) and it conſiſts in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: In the Approbation of all the Statutes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Commandements of God, <hi>Rom. 7. 12. The Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>I conſent unto the Law that it is good;</hi> there is both aſſent and conſent, <hi>Pſal. 119. 128. I eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian approves of all Divine Commands, though he can't perfectly keep all Divine Commands. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: It conſiſts in a Conſcientious ſubmiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Authority of all the Statutes of God. Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God hath an Authority within his heart, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his heart, <hi>Pſal. 119. 161. My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian ſtands in awe of every known Command of God, and hath a ſpiritual rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d unto them all, <hi>Pſal. 119. 6. I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements.</hi> But</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66517:38"/>
            <p>Thirdly: It conſiſts in a cordial willingneſs, and a cordial deſire to walk in all the Statutes of God, and to obey all the Commands of God, <hi>Rom. 7 18. For to Will is preſent with me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 5. <hi>O! that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>I will keep thy Statutes.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: It conſiſts in a ſweet complacency in all Gods Commands, <hi>Pſal. 119. 47. I will delight my ſelf in thy Commandement which I have loved,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: He who obeys ſincerely, obeys univerſally, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> though not in regard of practice (which is impoſſible) yet in regard of affection, he loves all the Commands of God, yea, he dearly loves thoſe very Commands of God, that he cannot obey, by reaſon of the infirmity of the fleſh, by reaſon of that body of ſin and death that he bears about with him; ponder upon that, <hi>Pſal. 119. 97. O how I love thy Law.</hi> Such a pang of love he felt, as could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be vented; but by this pathetical exclamation, <hi>O how I love thy Law,</hi> ver. 113, 163, 127, 159, 167. pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon all theſe verſes. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: A ſincere Chriſtian obeys all the Commands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of God; he is univerſal in his obedience, in reſpect of valuation or eſteem; he highly values all the Commands of God; he highly prizes all the Commands of God, as you may clearly ſee by comparing theſe Scriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pſal. 119. 72, 127, 128. Pſal. 19. 8, 9, 10, 11. Job</hi> 23. 12. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly: A ſincere Chriſtian is univerſal in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in reſpect of his purpoſe and reſolution; he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolves, by Divine aſſiſtance, to obey all, to keep all, <hi>Pſal. 119. 106. I have ſworn, and will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rform it, that I will keep thy Righteous Judgments,</hi> Pſal. 17. 3. <hi>I am purpoſed that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Eighthly: A ſincere Chriſtian is univerſal in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> In reſpect of his inclination, he has an habitual inclination in him to keep all the Commands of God, 1 <hi>King. 8. 57, 58. 2 Chron. 30. 17, 18, 19, 20. Pſal. 119. 112. I have inclined my heart to perform thy Statutes always, oven to the end.</hi> But</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66517:38"/>
            <p>Ninethly and laſtly: Their Evangelical keeping of all the commands of God conſiſts in their ſincere endeavour to keep them all; they put out themſelves in all the ways and parts of obedience; they do not willingly and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly ſlight or neglect any Commandement, but are ſtriving to conform themſelves thereunto; as a Dutiful Son doth all his Fathers commands, at leaſt in point of endeavour. So your ſincere Chriſtians make Conſcience of keeping all the Commands of God, in reſpect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, <hi>Pſal. 119. 59. I turned my feet unto thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> God eſteems of Evangelical Obedience, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience; <hi>Zacharias</hi> had his failings, he did heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate through unbelief, for which he was ſtruck dumb; yet the Text tells you, <hi>That he walked in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luk. 1. 6. Becauſe he did cordially deſire and endeavour to obey God in all things. Evangelical Obedience is true for the eſſence, though not perfect for the degree. A Child of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys all the Commands of God, in reſpect of his ſincere deſires, purpoſes, reſolutions, and endeavours; and this God accepts in Chriſt for perfect and compleat obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This is the glory of the Covenant of Grace, that God accepts and eſteems of ſincere obedience as perfect obedience. Such who ſincerely endeavour to keep the whole Law of God, they do keep the whole Law of God in an Evangelical ſenſe, though not in a legal ſenſe. A ſincere Chriſtian is for the firſt Table as well as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the ſecond as well as the firſt; he doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the firſt, and neglect the ſecond, as Hypocrites do; neither doth he adhere to the ſecond, and contemn the firſt, as prophane men do. O Chriſtians, for your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort, know, that when your deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are to do the Will of God entirely, as well in one thing as another, God will graciouſly pardon your failings, and paſs by your imperfections. <hi>He will ſpare you as a man ſpareth his Son that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. Though a Father ſee his Son to fail, and come ſhort in many things which he enjoyns him to do; yet knowing

            <p>The ſecond Queſtion or caſe is this, <hi>viz: What is that Faith that gives a man an intereſt in Chriſt, and in all thoſe bleſſed benefits and favours that comes by Chriſt? or whether that perſon that experiences the following particulars, may not ſafely, groundedly and comfortably conclude that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and ſuch a faith as clearly evidences a gracious Eſtate, and will certainly bring the Soul to Heaven?</hi> Now in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this important Queſtion, we may ſuppoſe the poor Believer is ready to expereſs himſelf thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt: Upon ſearch, and ſad experience, I find my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſelf a poor loſt, miſerable, and undone Creature, as the Scriptures every where do evidence, <hi>Ephe. 2. 1, 2, 5, 12. Coloſ. 2. 13. Rom. 8. 7, Luk.</hi> 19. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly: I am convinced that it is not in my ſelf to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deliver my ſelf out of this loſt, miſerable, and forlorne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; could I make as many Prayers as might be piled up between Heaven and Earth; and weep as much blood as there is water in the Sea, yet all this could not procure the pardon of one ſin, nor one ſmile from God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: I am convinced that it is not in Angels or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> men to deliver me out of my loſt, miſerable, and undone condition. I know provoked Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, Divine wrath pacified, my ſins pardoned, my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, my ſtate changed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or my ſoul can never be ſaved; and I know it is not in Angels or Men, to do any of theſe things for me.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: I find that I ſtand in abſolute need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to ſave me from wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 10. to ſave me from the curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. 13. <hi>and to ſave me from infernal ſlames,</hi> Iſa. 33. 14. <hi>ſo that I may well cry out with thoſe in</hi> Act. 2. 37. <hi>Men and Brethren</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:66517:39"/> 
               <hi>what ſhall we do: And with the Jaylour,</hi> Act. 16. 36. <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly: I ſee and know (through grace) that there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> an utter impoſſibility of obtaining ſalvation by any thing, or by any perſon, but by Chriſt alone, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Act. 4. 12. Neither is there Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other, for there is no other name</hi> (that is, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other perſon) <hi>under Heaven, given among men, by which we muſt be ſaved.</hi> I know there is no Saviour that can deliver me from eternal death, and bring me to eternal life and glory; but that Jeſus, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins,</hi> Luk. 1. 21. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt conclude that there is an utter impoſſibility of obtaining Salvation by any other perſon, or things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: I ſee and know (through grace) that Jeſus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Chriſt is an All-ſufficient Saviour, that he is a mighty, yea, an Almighty Saviour, a Saviour that is able to ſave to the utmoſt all them that come to him, as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal. 89. 19. I have laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> Iſa. 63. 1. <hi>I that ſpeak in Righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them. I know that the Lord Jeſus is mighty to ſave me from that Wrath, and from that Curſe, and from that Hell, and from that Damnation that is due to me, by reaſon of my ſins: And that he is mighty to juſtifie me, and mighty to pardon me, and mighty to reconcile me to God the Father, and mighty to bring me to glory, as the Scripture do's every where teſtifie. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly: I know (through grace) that Jeſus Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> is the only perſon anointed, appointed, fitted, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father, for that great and bleſſed work or office, of ſaving Sinners ſouls, as theſe Scriptures amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do clearly teſtifie, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1, 2, 3, 4. Luk. 4. 17. 18, 19, 20, 21. Math. 1. 20, 21. John</hi> 6. 27. Certainly were Jeſus Chriſt never ſo able, and mighty to ſave, yet
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66517:40"/> if he were not anointed, appointed, fitted, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father for that great office of ſaving poor lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Sinners; I know no reaſon why I ſhould expect Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him. But</p>
            <p>Eighthly: (I know through grace) that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Chriſt hath ſufficiently ſatisfied, as Mediatour, the juſtice of God, and pacified his wrath, and fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and procured the favour of God and the pardon of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all them that cloſe with him, that accept of him, as he is offered in the Goſpel of grace, <hi>Gal 3. 19, 20. 1 Tim. 2. 5. Heb. 8. 6. Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15. chap. 12. 24. <hi>Heb. 10. 12, 14. Math. 3. 15. Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. 33, 34. chap. 5. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>Ninethly: I find that Jeſus Chriſt is freely offered in the Goſpel to poor loſt undone Sinners, ſuch as I am. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> find that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are commanded by Chriſt to proclaim in his Name a general pardon, and to make a general offer of him to all, to whom they Preach the everlaſting Goſpel, without excluding any, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. And he ſaid unto them, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel unto every Creature;</hi> and what is it to preach the Goſpel unto every Creature, but to ſay unto them as the Angels did to the Shepherds? <hi>Luk. 2. 10, 11. I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the City of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Tenthly: I know (through grace) that all ſorts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> are invited to come to Chriſt, to receive Chriſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, and to cloſe with Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1, 2. Math. 11. 28, 29. Joh. 7. 37. Rev.</hi> 3. 20. and chap. 22. 17. &amp;c. But</p>
            <p>Eleventhly: Through grace I do in my underſtanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> really aſſent to that bleſſed record and report that God the Father, in the bleſſed Scriptures has given concerning Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. The report that God the Father has made concerning the Perſon of Chriſt, and concerning the Offices of Chriſt, and concerning the work of Redemption by Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> do really and cordially
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66517:40"/> aſſent unto, as moſt true and certain, upon the Authority of Gods Teſtimony, who is truth it ſelf, and cannot lye. Now though this aſſent alone is not enough to make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reception of Chriſt, yet it is in ſaving faith, and that without which, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any ſaving faith. But</p>
            <p>12thly. <hi>I</hi> can ſay (through grace) that in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> 
               <hi>I</hi> do approve of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not only as a good, but as the greateſt good, as a univerſal good, as a matchleſs good, as an incomparable good, as an infinit good, as an eternal good, and as the moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good in Heaven and Earth to my poor ſoul, as theſe Scriptures do evidence, <hi>Pſal. 73. 25, 26. Cant. 5. 10. 45. Pſal. 1, 2. Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. I know there is every thing in Chriſt that may ſuit the ſtate, caſe, neceſſities and wants of my poor ſoul; there is mercy in him to pardon me, and power in him to ſave me, and wiſdom in him to counſel me, and grace in him to enrich me, and righteouſneſs in him to cloath me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore I can't but approve of the Lord Jeſus, as ſuch a good as exceeds all the good that is to be found in Angels and Men; the good that I ſee in Chriſt doth not only counterpoiſe, but alſo excel all that real or imaginary good that every I have met with in any thing below Chriſt. Chriſt muſt come into the will, he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there, elſe he is never ſavingly received. Now before the Will will receive him, the Will muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed that he is good, yea, the beſt, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, or elſe he ſhall never be admitted there. Let the underſtanding aſſent never ſo much to all propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Chriſt, as true, if the judgment doth not approve of them as good, yea, as the beſt good, Chriſt will never be truly received; God in his working, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the faculties of the Soul in their actings, as he made them.</p>
            <p>13thly. So far as <hi>I</hi> know my own heart, <hi>I</hi> am ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> willing to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Covenant, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66517:41"/> 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. Iſa. 54. 5. Iſa. 61. 10. Iſa. 62. 5. Cant.</hi> 3. 11. &amp;c. Through grace <hi>I</hi> am,</p>
            <p>Firſt: Sincerely willing to take the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for my Saviour and Sovereign Lord. So far as <hi>I</hi> know my own heart, <hi>I</hi> do through mercy, give my hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that Chriſt, and Chriſt alone ſhall be my Saviour and Redeemer. It is true, I do duties, but the deſire of my ſoul is to do them out of love to Chriſt, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Royal Law and Pleaſure. I know my beſt Righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6. And woe would be to me, had I no other ſhelter, or Saviour, or reſting place for my poor ſoul, than rags, than filthy rags. And ſo far as I know my own heart, <hi>I</hi> am ſincerely willing to give up my ſelf to the guidance and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt, as my ſovereign Lord and King, deſiring nothing more in this world, than to live and die under the guidance and government of his Spirit, Word, and Grace. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: I am willing, through grace, to give a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Bill of Divorce to all other Lovers, without exception or reſervation. So far as I know my own heart, I deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in this world, than that God would pull out right-eye ſins, and cut off right-hand ſins. I am very deſirous, through grace, to have all ſins brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Power, Spirit, and Grace of Chriſt; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially my ſpecial ſins, my head corruptions. I would have Chriſt alone to Rule &amp; Reign in the haven of my heart, without any Competitour. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: I am ſincerely willing, through Grace, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> take the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Better, for Worſe, for Richer, for Poorer, in Sickneſs and in Health, and in his Strength: I would go with him through fire and water, reſolving (through his Grace) that nothing ſhall divide betwixt Chriſt and my Soul. So far as I know my own heart, I would have Chriſt, though I beg with him, though I go to Priſon with him, though in agonies in the Garden with him, though to the Croſs with him. But</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:66517:41"/>
            <p>Fourthly: So far as I know my own heart, I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> willing, Firſt, to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, 1 <hi>John</hi> 12. Secondly, to receive him in all his Offices, <hi>as King, Prophet, and Prieſt,</hi> Col. 2. 6. Acts 5. 31. Thirdly, To receive him into every room of my ſoul; to receive him into my underſtanding, mind, will, affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly: To receive him upon his own terms, of denying my ſelf; taking up his Croſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of him where-ever he goes, <hi>Math. 16. 21. Rev.</hi> 14. 4. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly: So far as I know my own heart, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> do freely conſent. 1. To be really Chriſts. 2. To be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Chriſts. 3. To be wholly Chriſts. 4. To be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſts. 5. To be eminently Chriſts. 6. To be for ever Chriſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly that Chriſtian that has and do's experience the particulars laſt mentioned under the ſecond queſtion, that Chriſtian may ſafely, groundedly, boldly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably conclude that his faith is a true, juſtifying, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, the Faith of Gods Elect, and ſuch a Faith as clearly evidences a gracious Eſtate, and will never leave his Soul ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now how many thouſand Chriſtians are there, that have this Faith that is here deſcribed, which is doubtleſs a true, juſtifying, ſaving Faith, that gives a man an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the perſon of Chriſt, and in all the bleſſings and benefits that comes by Chriſt, who yet queſtion whether they have true faith or no, partly from weakneſs, partly from temptations, and partly from the various definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are given of Faith by Proteſtants, both in their Preachings and Writings; and it is, and muſt be for a lamentation, that in a point of ſo great moment, the Trumpet ſhould give ſuch an uncertain ſound.</p>
            <p>The third Queſtion, or caſe is this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether in the great day of the Lord, the day of general Judgment, or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9. cap. 12. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. cap. 18. 23.</note> in the particular Judgment that will paſs upon every ſoul immediately after death, which is the ſtating of the ſoul in an Eternal eſtate or condition, either of happineſs or

Whether the Lord will either in the great day of account, or in a mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day of account or judgment, publickly manifeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and make mention of the ſins of his people, or no? This queſtion is bottomed upon the ten Scriptures in the Margent, which <hi>I</hi> deſire the Chriſtian Reader to conſult; and upon the ſad and daily complaints of many dear ſincere Chriſtians, who frequently cry out, <hi>O! we can never anſwer for one evil thought of ten thouſand, nor we</hi>

               <hi>can never anſwer for one idle word of twenty thouſand; nor we can never anſwer for one evil action of a hundred thouſand, and how then ſhall we ſtand in Judgment? how ſhall we look the Judg in the Face? how ſhall we be ever able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all our Omiſſions, and for all our Commiſſions; for all our ſins of Ignorance, and ſins againſt light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for all our ſins againſt the Law, and for all our ſins againſt the Goſpel, and for all our ſins againſt ſoveraign Grace, and for all our ſins againſt the Remedy, againſt the Lord Jeſus, and for all the ſins of our Infancy, of our Youth,</hi>

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 27.</note> 
               <hi>and of old Age,</hi> &amp;c. What account ſhall we be able to give up, when we come to our particular day of Judg-ment, immediately after our death, or in the great and general day of account, when Angels, Devils, &amp; Men ſhall ſtand before the Lord Jeſus; whom God the Father hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be the Judge of Quick and Dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31.</p>
            <p>Now to this great Queſtion I Anſwer, that the ſins of the Saints, the infirmities and enormities of Believers ſhall never be brought into the Judgment of diſcuſſion and diſcovery, they ſhall never be objected againſt them, either in their particular day of Judgment, or in the great day of their Account. Now this truth I ſhall make good by an induction of particulars thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in His judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the laſt day, which is ſet down clearly and largely in <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 34. to ver. 42. doth only enumerate the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66517:42"/> good works they have done, but takes not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tice of the ſpots and blemiſhes of the infirmities or enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut. 32. 4, 5, 6. Dan.</hi> 9. 24.</note> of the weakneſſes or wickedneſſes of his people. God has ſealed up the ſins of his people, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred or lookt upon more. In the great day, the book of Gods Remembrance ſhall be opened, and publickly read, that all the good things that the Saints have done for God, for Chriſt, for Saints, for their own Souls, for Sinners; and that all the great things that they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Chriſt's ſake, and the Goſpels ſake, may be mentioned to their everlaſting praiſe, to their eternal honour. And though the choiceſt and chiefeſt Saints on <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom 7. 23, 24. Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</note> Earth have, 1. Sin dwelling in them: 2. Operating and working in them. 3. Vexing and moleſting of them, being as ſo many Goads in their ſides, and Thorns in their eyes. 4. Captivating and prevailing over them, yet in that large Recital which ſhall then be read of the Saints lives, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. There is not the leaſt mention made either of ſins of Omiſſion, or Commiſſion; nor the leaſt mention made, either of great ſins, or of ſmall ſins; nor the leaſt mention made, either of ſins before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or after Converſion. Here in this world the beſt of Saints have had their buts, their ſpots, their blots, their ſpecks, as the faireſt day hath its Clouds, the fineſt Linnen its ſpots, and the richeſt Jewels their ſpecks; but now in the judicial proceſs of this laſt and univerſal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes there is not found in all the Books that ſhall then be opened, ſo much as one unſavory but, to blemiſh the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev. 20. 12. Dan. 7. 10. Num.</hi> 23. 21.</note> fair Characters of the Saints.

                  <hi>John 17. Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</note> Heaven, he won't (though he hath cauſe to blame them for many things) ſpeak any thing againſt them in the great day. Surely Jeſus Chriſt, the Saints Pay-maſter, <note place="margin">

It cannot be imagined that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the great day, will bring in any new charge againſt his Children, when they have been cleared and abſolved already. Certainly when once the Saints are freely and fully Abſolved from all their ſins by a Divine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66517:43"/> Sentence, then their ſins ſhall never be remembred, they ſhall never be objected againſt them any more. For one Divine Sentence cannot croſs and reſcind another: the Judge of all the world had long ſince caſt all their ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back, and will he now ſet them before his face, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 17.</note> and before the faces of all the world? ſurely no, he has long ſince caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea, (bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs depths of everlaſting Oblivion) that they might <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Micah.</hi> 7. 19.</note> never be buoyed up any more! He has not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given their ſins, but he has alſo forgotten their ſins: And <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34.</note> will he remember them, and declare them in the great day? ſurely no: God has long ſince blotted out the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa</hi> 43. 25.</note> of his people. This Metaphor is taken from Creditors, who when they purpoſe never to exact a Debt, will blot it out of their Books. Now after that a Debt is ſtrucken out of a Bill, Bond, or Book, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exacted; the Evidence cannot be pleaded, Chriſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.</note> having croſt the debt-Book with the red lines of his Blood. If now he ſhould call the ſins of his people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and charge them upon them, he ſhould croſs the great deſign of his croſs: Upon this foundation ſtands the abſolute impoſſibility that any ſin, that the least ſin, yea, that the leaſt circumſtance of ſin, or the leaſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin ſhould be ſo much as mentioned by the Righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, in the proceſs of that judicial Tryal in the great day, except it be in a way of abſolution, in order to the magnifying of their pardon. God has long ſince blotted out as a thick Cloud <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 22.</note> the tranſgreſſions of his people, and as a Cloud, their ſins. Now we know that the clouds, which are driven away by the winds, appear no more; nor the Miſt which is dryed up by the Sun, appears no more, other Clouds, and other Miſts may ariſe, but not they which are driven away and dryed up. Thus the Sins of the Saints being forgiven, they ſhall no more return upon them; they ſhall never more be objected againſt them.</p>
            <p>Further, The Lord ſaith, <hi>Though your ſins be as Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66517:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll: Pardon makes ſuch a clear riddance of ſin, that it is as if it had never been; the Scarlet Sinner is as white as Snow, Snow newly fallen from the Skye, which was never ſullied: The Crimſon Sinner is as Wool, Wool which never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt tincture in the Dye-fat: you know Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Crimſon are double and deep dyes, dyes in grain; yet if the Cloath dyed therewith, be as the Wooll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was dyed, and if it be as white as Snow, what is become of thoſe dyes? are they any more? is not the Cloath as if it had not been dyed at all? even ſo, though our ſins by reiterating them, by long lying in them, have made deep impreſſions upon us, yet by Gods diſcharge of them, we are as if we had never committed them.</p>
            <p>Again, The Pſalmiſt pronounceth him bleſſed, whoſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1.</note> ſin is covered. A thing covered is not ſeen; ſo ſin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, is before God as not ſeen: The ſame Pſalmiſt pronounceth him bleſſed, to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now a ſin not imputed, is as not committed. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Iniquity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>and they ſhall not be found.</hi> Now is not that fully <note place="margin">

Thus by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Metaphors uſed in Scripture, to ſet out forgiveneſs of ſin, pardon of ſin, you plainly and evidently ſee, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer. 31. 34. Ezek.</hi> 18. 22.</note> God's diſcharge is free and full, and therefore he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charge their ſins upon them in the great day. But</p>
            <p>Some may object and ſay, that the Scripture ſaith, that God ſhall bring every work into Judgment, with every <note place="margin">

               <hi>for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins. I have blotted out, as a thick Cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a Cloud, thy ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is this that blots our tranſgreſſions? he that hath the keys of Heaven and Hell at his girdle; that opens and no man ſhuts; that ſhuts and no man opens; he that hath the power of life and death, of condemning and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, of killing and making alive; he it is that blott<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out tranſgreſſions: If an Under-Officer ſhould blot
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66517:45"/> out an Indictment, that perhaps might do a man no good; a man might for all that, be at laſt, caſt by the Judge; but when the Judge, or King, ſhall blot out the Indictment with their own hand, then the Indictment cannot return; now this is every Believers caſe and happineſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The meaning is, their iniquities ſhall be quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I will never mention them more, I will never take notice of them more, they ſhall never hear more of them from me: though God hath an Iron memory to remember the ſins of the wicked, yet he hath no memory to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſins of the righteous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: His not bringing their ſins into Judgment, doth moſt and beſt agree with thoſe bleſſed expreſſions, of his caſting their ſins into the depth of the Sea; and of his caſting them behind his back. <hi>He will turn again, he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Where ſin is once Pardoned, the Remiſſion ſtands never to be repealed; pardoned-ſin ſhall never come in account againſt the pardoned man, before God any more; for ſo much doth this borrowed ſpeech import: If a thing were caſt into a River, it might be brought up again; or if it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66517:46"/> were caſt upon the Sea, it might be diſcerned and taken up again; but when it is caſt into the depths, the bottom of the Sea, it can never be buoyed up again.</p>
            <p>By the Metaphor in the Text, the Lord would have us to know, that ſins pardoned ſhall riſe no more, they ſhall never be ſeen more, they ſhall never come on the account more; he will ſo drown their ſins, that they ſhall never come up before him the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>And ſo much that other Scripture imports; <hi>Behold,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 17.</note>

               </hi> Theſe laſt words are a borrowed ſpeech, taken from the manner of men, who are wont to caſt behind their backs, ſuch things as they have no mind to ſee, regard, or remember. A gracious ſoul hath always his ſins before his face, <hi>(I acknowledge</hi>

            <p>Fourthly: <hi>His not bringing their ſins into Judgment,</hi> doth beſt agree with that ſweet and choice expreſſion of Gods pardoning the ſins of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their Iniquity, whereby</hi>

            <p>Fifthly: <hi>His not bringing their ſins into the Judgment of Diſcuſſion and Diſcovery,</hi> doth beſt agree to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of forgiving, and covering; <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> In the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <note place="margin">

                  </gap>vel. ntur.</note> which is oppoſed to diſcloſure; to be covered, it is to be ſo hid and cloſed, as not to appear. Some make the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor from filthy, loathſome objects, which are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our eyes, as dead carcaſſes are buried under the ground; ſome from Garments, that are put upon us to cover our nakedneſs; others from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that were drowned in the red Sea, and ſo covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; others from a great Gulf in the earth, that is filled up, and covered with earth, injected into it; and others make it in the laſt place, an alluſive expreſſion to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, over which was a covering.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66517:47"/>
            <p>Now all theſe Metaphors in the general, tend to ſhew this, that the Lord will not look, he will not ſee, he will not take notice of the ſins he hath pardoned, to call them any more to a judicial account.</p>
            <p>As when a Prince reads over many Treaſons, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and meets with ſuch and ſuch, which he hath pardoned, he reads on, he paſſeth by, he taketh no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, the pardoned perſon ſhall never hear more of them, he will never call him to account for thoſe ſins more. So here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was painted, he puts his finger upon his ſcar, his wart. God puts his fingers upon all his peoples ſcars and warts, upon all their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities, that nothing can be ſeen but what is fair and lovely; <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, and there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> Cant. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: It beſt agrees to that expreſſion of not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſin. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not Iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> So <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly: It beſt agrees with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that you have in the 113. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 11, and 12. <hi>Verſes, For as the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that fear him; as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions from us.</hi> What a vaſt diſtance is there betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt? of all viſible latitudes, this is the greateſt; and thus much for the third Argument. The</p>
            <p>Fourth Argument that prevails with me, to judge that Jeſus Chriſt will not bring the ſins of the Saints into the judgement of diſcuſſion and diſcovery in the great day, is, becauſe it ſeems unſuitable to three conſiderable things, for Jeſus Chriſt to proclaim the infirmities and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of his people to all the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt: It ſeems to be unſuitable to the glory and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of that day, which to the Saints will be a day of refreſhing, a day of Reſtitution, a day of Redemption,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66517:47"/> a day of Coronation, as hath been already proved; now how ſuitable to this great day of ſolemnity, the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Saints ſins will be, I leave the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>Secondly: It ſeems unſuitable to all thoſe near and dear relations, that Jeſus Chriſt ſtands in towards his; <note place="margin">

By how much he is more a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Brother,</hi> a <hi>Head,</hi> a <hi>Husband,</hi> &amp;c. in a ſpiritual way, than any others can be in a natural way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: It ſeems very unſuitable to what the Lord Jeſus requires of his in this world; the Lord requires that his people ſhould caſt a Mantle of Love, of Wiſdom, of Silence, and Secreſie over one anothers weakneſſes and infirmities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hatred ſtirreth up ſtrifes, but Love covereth all ſins: Loves mantle is very large; Love will find a hand, a plaiſter to clap upon every ſore. <hi>Flavius Veſpacianus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 10 12. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4: 8:</note> (the Emperour) was very ready to conncal his friends Vices, and as ready to reveal their Vertues: So is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love in the hearts of the Saints, <hi>If thy Brother offend thee, go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone; If he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother.</hi> As the Pills of Reprehenſion are to be gilded and ſugar'd over <note place="margin">

            <p>Heaven is too hot, and too holy a place for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 3. Now will Jeſus Chriſt have us carry it thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards offending Chriſtians, and will he himſelf act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Nay, is it an evil in us to lay open the weakneſſes and infirmities of the Saints to the World? and will it be an excellency, a glory, a vertue in Chriſt, to do it in the great day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66517:48"/>
            <p>A fiſth Argument, is this, It is the glory of a man to paſs over a Tranſgreſſion, <hi>The diſcretion of a man deferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his anger, and it is his glory to paſs over a tranſgreſſion,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

Now, <hi>is it the glory of a man to paſs over a tranſgreſſion,</hi> and will it not much more be the glory of Chriſt, ſilently to paſs over <note place="margin">

The greater the Treaſons and Rebellions are, that a Prince paſſes over, and takes no notice of, the more is his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory: and ſo doubtleſs it will be Chriſts in that great day, to paſs over all the Treaſons and Rebellions of his people; to take no notice of them, to forget them as well as to forgive them.</p>
            <p>The Heathens have long ſince obſerved, that in nothing man came nearer to the Glory and Perfection of God himſelf, than in Goodneſs and Clemency; Surely, if it be ſuch an honour to man, <hi>to paſs over a Tranſgreſſion,</hi> it cannot be a diſhonour to Chriſt, to paſs over the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of his people, he having already buried them in the Sea of his blood. Again, ſaith <hi>Solomon, It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God to conceal a thing.</hi> And why it ſhould not make <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov</hi> 25. 2.</note> for the Glory of Divine Love, to conceal the ſins of the Saints, in that great Day, I know not: And whether the concealing the ſins of the Saints in the great day, will not make moſt for their joy, and wicked mens ſorrows, for their comfort, and wicked mens terrour and torment, I will leave you to judge, and time and experience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; and thus much for the reſolution of that great queſtion.</p>
            <p>Now from what has been ſaid, in anſwer to this third Queſtion, a ſincere Chriſtian may form up this firſt plea as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11 9. cap. 12. 14. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 14. cap. 18. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16 3. <hi>Rom</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O bleſſed God, Jeſus Chriſt has by his own blood bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced and made up all reckonings and accounts that were between thee and me; and thou haſt vehemently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66517:48"/> 
               <hi>that thou wilt not bring me into Judgment; that thou wilt blot out my Tranſgreſſions as a thick Cloud, and that thou wilt remember my ſins no more; and that thou wilt caſt them behind thy back, and hurl them into the depth of the Sea; and that thou wilt forgive them, and cover them, and not impute them to me,</hi> &amp;c. This is my Plea, O Lord, and by this plea I ſhall ſtand; <hi>Well,</hi> ſaith the Judge of Quick and Dead, <hi>I own this plea, I accept of this plea, I have nothing to ſay againſt this plea; the plea is juſt, ſafe, honourable and righteous, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly: Every Sinner at his firſt believing and cloſing with Chriſt, is juſtified in the Court of glory from all his ſins, both guilt and puniſhment. Juſtification <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.</note> doth not increaſe or decreaſe, but all ſin is pardoned at the firſt act of believing. All who are juſtified, are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alike; there is no difference amongſt Believers, as to their juſtification, one is not more juſtified than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for every juſtified perſon hath a plenary Remiſſion of his ſins, and the ſame Righteouſneſs of Chriſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but in Sanctification there is difference amongſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Every one is not ſanctified alike, for ſome are <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 19, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 14. 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2 1. 12, 13, 14.</note> ſtronger and higher, and others are weaker and lower in grace: As ſoon as any are made Believers in Chriſt, all the ſins which they have committed in time paſt, and all the ſins which they are guilty of, as to the time preſent, they are actually pardoned unto them in general, and in particular. Now that all the ſins of a Believer are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned at once, and actually unto them, may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
            <p>Firſt: All phraſes in Scripture imply thus much, <hi>Eſa. 43. 25. I, even I am he, which blotteth out thy Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins,</hi> Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſin no more,</hi> Jer. 33. 8. <hi>And I will pardon all their Iniquities whereby they have ſinned, and whereby they have Tranſgreſſed againſt me,</hi> Ezek. 18. 22. <hi>All his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned</hi>

                  </gap>re;</hi> ergo, all is pardoned at once. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: That Remiſſion of ſins that leaves no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the party offending, is the Remiſſion of all ſins; for if there were any ſin remaining, a man is ſtill in <note place="margin">2.

                  </gap>t, preſent, and to come, though not an equal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the ſtate of Condemnation; but Juſtification leaves no Condemnation; <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 1. verſ. <hi>There is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ver 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth;</hi> and ver. 38, 39. <hi>Nor things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord;</hi> and Joh. 5. 24. <hi>He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but is paſſed from death to life:</hi> ergo, all ſins are pardoned at once, or elſe they were in a ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee it evident, that there is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is full remiſſion of all ſins to the ſoul at the firſt act of believing. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: A Believer (even when he ſinneth) is ſtill united to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1. 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>And he is ſtill Cloathed with the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt which covers all his ſins, and diſchargeth him from them, ſo that no guilt can redound to him,</hi> Iſa 61. 10. Jer. 23. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Phil. 3. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: A Believer is not to fear Curſe, or Hell, at all, which yet he might do if all his ſins were not pardoned at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> once; but ſome of his new ſins were for a while unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, &amp;c. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by once ſuffering, ſuffered for all the ſins of the Elect, paſt, preſent, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> come; the infinite wrath of God, the Father, fell on him for all the ſins of the choſen of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. chap. 10. 9, 10, 12, 14. If Chriſt had ſuffered for ten thouſand worlds, he could have ſuffered no more than he did; for he ſuffered the whole infinite wrath of God the Father; the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66517:49"/> wrath of God was infinite wrath, &amp; the ſufferings of Chriſt were infinite ſufferings; <hi>ergo,</hi> Look as <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to infect a thouſand worlds, ſo our Saviours me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſufficient to ſave a thouſand worlds; thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that he ſuffered for ſins paſt, are ſufficient to ſatisfie for ſins preſent, and to come. That all the ſins of Gods <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 5, 6.</note> people (in their abſolute number, from firſt to laſt) were laid upon Chriſt, who in the days of his ſufferings, did meritoriouſly purchaſe perfect remiſſion of all their ſins; to be applyed in future times to them, and by them is moſt certain. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: Repentance is not at all required for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (where our pardon is only to be found) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Faith; therefore pardon of ſin is not ſuſpended, until we repent of our ſins. But</p>
            <p>Sevently: If the Remiſſion of all ſins be not at once, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> it is either becauſe my faith cannot lay hold on it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſome hinderances in the way: But a man by the hand of faith, may lay hold on all the merits of Chriſt, and the word reveals the pardon of all; and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſeals and confirms the pardon of all; and there is no danger nor inconvenience that attends this aſſertion, for it puts the higheſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imaginable upon the ſoul, as to fear and obedience, <hi>Pſal. 1 30. 3. v. If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark Iniquities? O Lord, who ſhall ſtand,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> Forgiveneſs makes not a Chriſtian bold with ſin, but fearful of ſin, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obey, as Chriſtians find in their daily experience: By this Argument it appears clear, that the forgiveneſs of all ſins is made to the ſoul at once, at the firſt act of Believing. But</p>
            <p>Eightly: If new ſins were not pardoned until you do repent, then we ſhould be left to an uncertainty whiles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> our ſins be pardoned, or when they will be pardoned; <hi>for it may be long ere we repent,</hi> as you ſee in <hi>David,</hi> who lay long under the guilt of Murther and Adultery before he repented; and you know <hi>Solomon</hi> lay long under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66517:50"/> high ſins before he repented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it may be more long ere we do, or can know that we do truly repent of our ſins. But</p>
            <p>Ninethly: If all ſins were not forgiven at once, then juſtification is not perfect at once, but is more and more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> increaſed and perfected, as more and more ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which cannot conſiſt with the true doctrine of juſtification. Certainly, as to the ſtate of juſtification, there is a full and perfect remiſſion of all ſins (conſidered under the differences of time paſt, preſent, and to come) as in the ſtate of Condemnation, there is not any one ſin pardoned, ſo in the eſtate of Juſtification, there is not any one ſin but is pardoned; for the ſtate of Juſtification is oppoſite to all Condemnation, and Curſe, and Wrath. But</p>
            <p>Tenthly: All agree, that as to Gods eternal decree or purpoſe of forgiveneſs, all the ſins of his people are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> God did not intend to forgive ſome of their ſins, and not the reſt, but an univerſal and full, and compleat forgiveneſs was fixedly purpoſed and reſolved on by God. Forgiveneſs of ſins is a gracious act, or work of God for Chriſt ſake, diſcharging and abſolving, believing and repenting perſons, from the guilt and puniſhment of all their ſins; ſo that God is no longer diſpleaſed with them, nor will he ever remember them any more, nor call them to an account for them, nor condemn them for their ſins, but will look on them, and deal with them as if they had never ſinned, never offended him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Conſider, that at the very moment of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers diſſolution, all his ſins are perfectly and fully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all their ſins are ſo fully and finally forgiven them, that at the very moment of their ſouls going out from the body, there is not one ſin of omiſſion or commiſſion, nor any aggravation, or leaſt circumſtance left ſtanding in the book of Gods remembrance; and this is the true reaſon why there ſhall not be the leaſt mention made of their ſins in their tryal at Chriſts Tribunal, becauſe they were all pardoned fully and finally at the hour of their death; all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66517:50"/> debts were then diſcharged, all ſcores were then croſſed; ſo that in the great day, when the Books ſhall be opened and peruſed, there ſhall not one ſin be found, but all blotted out, and all reckonings made even in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if God ſhould pardon ſome ſins, and not others, he would at the ſame time be a friend and an enemy, and we ſhould be at once both happy and miſerable, which are manifeſt contradictions; beſides, God doth nothing in vain: But it would be in vain for God to pardon ſome ſins, but not all! for as one leak in a Ship, unſtopped, will ſink the Ship; and as one ſore, or one diſeaſe, not healed, nor cured, will kill the body, ſo one ſin unpardoned will deſtroy the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: God looks not upon thoſe as Sinners, whoſe ſins are pardoned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 37. <hi>And behold a Woman in the</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>City which was a ſinner:</hi> A notorious ſinner, a branded ſinner; mark, it is not ſaid, behold a Woman which is a ſinner, but <hi>behold a Woman which was a ſinner;</hi> to note, that ſinners converted and pardoned, are no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſinners. <hi>Behold a Woman which was a ſinner:</hi> look as a man, when he is cleanſed from filth, is as if he had never been defiled; ſo when a Sinner is pardoned, he is in Gods account, as if he had never ſinned. Hence thoſe phraſes in <hi>Cant. 4. 7. Thou art all fair my love, and there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> Col. 2. 10. <hi>And ye are compleat in him who is the head of all principality and power;</hi> as though he had ſaid, Becauſe in himſelf he hath the Well-head of Glory and Majeſty, the which becometh ours; in that he is alſo the head of his Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>And you that were ſomtime alienated, and Enemies in your mind, by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>In the body of his fleſh, through death, to preſent you holy, and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unreproveable in his ſight;</hi> that is, by his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed and imparted; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> The word preſent, is taken from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66517:51"/> the cuſtom of ſolemnizing a Marriage; firſt the Spouſe was woed, and then ſet before her Husband adorned with his Jewels, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was with <hi>Iſaacs; Rev. 14. 5. And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault, before the Throne of God.</hi> 1. They are without fault by imputation. 2. By inchoation. Hence <hi>Job</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to be a perfect man, Job</hi> 1. And <hi>David to be a man after Gods own heart;</hi> Act. 13. 22. <hi>The forgiven party is now looked upon, and received with that love and favour, as if he had never offended God, and as if God had never been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by him,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 1, 2, 4. Iſa. 54. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34, 36, 37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Here the ſins of the Prodigal are pardoned, and his Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him with ſuch expreſſions of love and familiarity, as if he had never ſinned againſt him; his Father never ſo much as objects any one of all his high ſinnings againſt him. Hence it is that you read of ſuch ſweet, kind, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, loving, comfortable expreſſions of God towards thoſe whoſe ſins he had pardoned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 16. <hi>Refrain thy voyce from weeping, and thine eyes from tears,</hi> verſe 20. <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child?</hi> Math. 9. 2. <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> The Schools ſay, that the remiſſion of ſins is not only <hi>oblativa mali,</hi> but <hi>collativa boni,</hi> a remotion of guilt, but a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good. Look as he that is legally acquitted of Theft, or Murder, is no more reputed a Thief or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deter; ſo here, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>In thoſe days, and in that time,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>the Iniquity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi> Pardoned ſin, is in Gods account no ſin; and the pardoned ſinner in Gods account is no ſinner, as the pardoned deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is no debtor. Where God hath pardoned a man, there he never looks upon that man as a ſiner, but as a juſt man. Pardon of ſin is an utter abolition of it, as it doth reflect upon the perſon making him guilty, and obliging him actually to condemnation; in this reſpect the pardoned man is as free as if he had never ſinned. Therefore the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66517:51"/> Believer, the Penitent perſon hath inſinite cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, that God hath perfectly pardoned his ſins, and that he looks upon him no more a ſinner, but as a juſt and righteous perſon. O Sirs, what can the great God do more for your comfort and conſolation; and therefore never entertain any hard thoughts of God, as if he were like thoſe men, who ſay, <hi>they forgive with all their hearts,</hi> and yet retain their ſecret hatred and inward malice as much as ever, but for ever live in the ſaith of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That when God doth pardon ſin, he takes it ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as that the party acquitted is no more looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a ſinner. Now upon this conſideration, what a glorious plea hath every ſincere Chriſtian to make in the day of account. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Forgiveneſs takes off our obligation to ſuffer eternal puniſhment; ſo that look as a forgiven Debtor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is freed from whatſoever penalty his debt did render him liable to; ſo is the forgiven ſinner from the puniſhment it ſelf. In this reſpect <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>To forgive ſin, is not to puniſh it.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>To forgive ſin, is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment due unto it.</hi> And the Schools ſay, <hi>To remit the ſin, is not to impute the puniſhment.</hi> When a King pardons a Thief, his theft now ſhall not prejudice him. The guilt obliging, is that whereby the ſinner is actually bound to undergoe the puniſhment due to him by the Law, and paſſed on him by the Judge for the breach of it; this is that which by the Schools is called the Extrinſecal guilt of ſin, to diſtinguiſh it from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal, which is included in the deordination of the act, and which is inſeparable from the ſin. And if you would know wherein the nature of forgiveneſs; immediately, and primarily conſiſts, it is in the taking off this Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcharging the ſinner from it. Hence it is that the pardoned ſinner is ſaid not to be under the Law; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>and not to be under the Curſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>and not to be under the ſentence of Condemnation.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this notion, all Scripture-phraſes are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</note> by which forgiveneſs is expreſſed. God, <hi>when he</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:66517:52"/> 
               <hi>forgives ſin, he is ſaid to cover them,</hi> Pſal. 32. 1. Pſal. 85. 2. Rom. 4. 7. <hi>to remember them no more,</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. Jer. 31. 34. Heb. 8. 12. <hi>To caſt them behind his back,</hi> Iſa. 38. 17. <hi>To throw him into the depth of the Sea,</hi> Mica. 7. 19. <hi>To blot them out as a Cloud,</hi> Iſa. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 22. <hi>And to turn away his face from them,</hi> Pſal. 51. 9. By all which expreſſions we are not to think that God doth not know ſin, or that God doth not ſee ſin, or that God is not diſpleaſed with ſin, or that God is not diſpleaſed with Believers for their ſins; but that he will not ſo take notice of them, as to enter into judgment with the perſons for them. So that the forgiven ſinner is free from Obligation of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as truly, as ſurely, as fully, and as perfectly, as if he had never committed the ſin, but were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent In every ſin there are two things conſiderable; Firſt, The offence which is done to God, whereby he is diſpleaſed: Secondly, The Obligation of the man ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him to eternal Condemnation. Now remiſſion of ſin doth wholly lye in the removeing of theſe two; ſo that when God doth Will neither to puniſh, or to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the perſon, then he is ſaid to forgive. It is true, there remains paternal and medicinal Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after ſin is forgiven, but no offence or puniſhment ſtrictly ſo taken: And is not this a noble plea for a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make in the day of account? But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: Conſider that all the ſins of Believers were laid upon Chriſt their Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21, 22. Whats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that? that is, he became bound to God, he became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to him for all their ſins, for all that God in juſtice could charge upon them, and demand for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5, 6. <hi>Our Salvation was lai upon one that is mighty,</hi> Pſal. 89. 19. Iſa. 63. 1. <hi>As</hi> Judah <hi>became a Surety to</hi> Jacob <hi>for</hi> Benjamin, <hi>he engaged himſelf to his Father, I will be Surety for him, of my hand ſhalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him; if I bring him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66517:52"/> duty, and Gods Surety to us for the performance of his Promiſes. <hi>Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will take upon me all the ſins of thy people; I will be bound to anſwer for them; I will Sacrifice my ſelf for them; at my hands do thou require ſatisfaction for their ſins, and a full compenſation unto thy juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, I will make my ſoul an offering for ſins; I will become a Curſe, I will endure thy Wrath.</hi> O what unſpeakable comfort is this, that there is a Chriſt to anſwer for that which we could never anſwer; Chriſt is a Surety in way of ſatisfaction, undertaking for the Debts, the Treſpaſſes, the Sins of his Elect; in this reſpect it is that Chriſt is moſt properly called a Surety, in regard of his taking upon him the ſins of his Elect, and undertaking to anſwer and make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto the juſtice of God for them. Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf betwixt the wrath of God and his people, undertaking to ſatisfie their debts, and ſo to reconcile them unto God. Chriſt had nothing of his own to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for; nothing of his own to be ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He appeared the firſt time with your ſin to his Condemnation, He ſhall appear the ſecond time without your ſin, unto your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. God the Father ſays to Chriſt, <hi>Son, if you would have poor Sinners pardoned, you muſt take their Debts upon your ſelf, you muſt be their Surety, and you muſt enter into Bonds to pay every farthing of that Debt poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners owe; you muſt pay all if you will undertake for them; for I will ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By way of imputation, <hi>for our ſins were made to meet upon him,</hi> as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66517:53"/> that Evangelical Prophet hath it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Reputation, <hi>for he was reckoned among Malefactors,</hi> ver. 12. The way of pardon is by a tranſlation of all our ſins upon Chriſt, it is by charging them all upon Chriſts ſcore. That is a great expreſſion of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David; The Lord hath put away thy ſin:</hi> But the Original runs thus, <hi>The Lord hath made thy ſins to paſs over;</hi> that is, to <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam</hi> 12. 13.</note> paſs over from thee to his Son; he hath laid them to his charge.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt hath diſcharged all his Peoples Debts and Bonds. There is a two-fold debt which lay upon us, one was the debt of Obedience unto the Law; and this Chriſt did pay by <hi>fulfilling all Righteouſneſs,</hi> Math. 3. 15. The other was the debt of puniſhment, for our tranſgreſſions; and this debt Chriſt diſcharged by his Death on the Croſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 10, 12. <hi>and by being made a Curſe for us, to redeem us from the Curſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. Hence it is, that we are ſaid to be bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. chap. 7. 23. and that Chriſt is called our <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſom.</hi> Lutron. <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 28. and <hi>Antilutron,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6. The words do ſignifie a valuable price laid down for anothers Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. The Blood of Chriſt (the Son of God) was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable price, a ſufficient price; it was as much as would take off all Enmities, and take away all Sin, and to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and indeed ſo it did; and therefore you read, <hi>That in his blood we have Redemption, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14, 20. and his death was ſuch a full compenſation to divine Juſtice, that the Apoſtle makes a challenge to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Who is he that Condemneth, it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Chriſt hath ſatisfied and diſcharged all. The Greek word <hi>Antilutron</hi> is of ſpecial Emphaſis: The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine renders it <hi>Redemptionem,</hi> Redemption; <hi>Beza Redemptioms precium,</hi> a price of Redemption; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them fully expreſſing the force of the word, which properly ſignifieth a counter-price, when one doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe in the room of another, that which he ſhould have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66517:53"/> undergone in his own perſon. As when one yields himſelf a Captive for the Redeeming of another out of Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or giveth his own life for the ſaving of anothers. There were ſuch Sureties among the Greeks, as gave life for life, body for body; and in this ſence the Apoſtle is to be underſtood, when he ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Ranſom, a counter-price, paying a price for his people. Chriſt hath laid down a price for all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; <hi>they are his dear bought Ones, they are his choyce redeemed Ones,</hi> Iſa. 51. 11. Chriſt gave himſelf <hi>Antilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> a counter-price, a Ranſom, ſubmitting himſelf to the like puniſhment that his redeemed Ones ſhould have undergone. Chriſt, to deliver his Elect from the Curſe of the Law, did ſubject himſelf to that ſame Curſe of the Law, under which all man-kind lay. Jeſus Chriſt was a true Surety, one that gave his life for the life of others, as the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> that the one redeemed the others life with his own death. So did the Lord Jeſus, he became ſuch a Surety for his Elect, giving himſelf an <hi>Antilutron,</hi> a Ranſom for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. chap. 5. 9. O what comfort is this unto us to have ſuch a Jeſus, who himſelf bare our ſins, even all our ſins, left not one unſatisfied for! laid down a full ranſom, a full price, ſuch an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice, as that now we are out of the hands of Juſtice, and Wrath, and Death, and Curſe, and Hell, and are reconciled, and made near by the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, the Blood of Chriſt (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks) <hi>is the Blood of God,</hi> Act. 20. 28. So that there is not only ſatisfaction, but merit in his Blood; there is more in Chriſts Blood than meer payment or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; there was merit alſo in it, to acquire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and purchaſe all ſpiritual good, and all eternal good; for the people of God, not only immunities from ſin, Death, Wrath, Curſe, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but priviledges and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Sons and Heirs; yea, all Grace, and all Love, and all Peace, and all Glory; even that glorious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance purchaſed by his Blood, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:66517:54"/>
            <p>Remember this once for all, that in juſtification our debts are charged upon Chriſt, they go upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; you know that in ſin, there is the vicious and ſtaining quality of it, and there is the reſulting guilt of it, which is the obligation of a Sinner over to the Judgment Seat of God to anſwer for it. Now this guilt (in which lies our debt) this is charged upon Chriſt. Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>And hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin,</hi> ver. 21. You know in Law, the Wifes Debts are charged upon the Husband; and if the Debtor be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, than the Creditor ſues the Surety. <hi>Fide juſſor,</hi> or Surety and Debitor, in Law, are reputed as one perſon. Now Chriſt is our <hi>Fide juſſor, He is made ſin for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>for us,</hi> that is in our ſtead. A Surety for us, one who puts our ſcores on his accounts, our burden on his ſhoulders; ſo ſaith that Princely Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 5. <hi>He hath born our griefs, and carried our ſoroows;</hi> how ſo? <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions; he was bruiſed for our iniquities;</hi> that is, he ſtood in our ſtead, he took upon him the anſwering of our ſins, the ſatisfying of our debts, the clearing of our guilt; and therefore was it, that he was ſo bruiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>to be our Surety, and Mediator, and Redeemer, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? for as much as Chriſt could not be any one of theſe, for, and unto us, but by a willing ſuſception of our ſins upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be for them reſponſible unto the juſtice of God, in ſuffering thoſe puniſhments which were due for our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak a few words to this main Queſtion. I ſay then, that it is not always, and in all caſes unjuſt; but it is ſomtimes, and in ſome caſes very juſt to puniſh one who is himſelf Innocent; for him, or thoſe, who are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nocent, and guilty; <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book, <hi>de ſatisfactione,</hi> gives divers inſtances; but <hi>I</hi> ſhall mention only two.</p>
            <p>Firſt: In caſe of Conjunction where the innocent party, and the nocent party do become legally one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore, if a Man Marries a Woman indebted, he thereupon becomes obnoxious to pay her debts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though abſolutely conſidered, he was not obnoxious thereunto. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: In caſe of Surety-ſhip, where a perſon knowing the weak and inſufficient condition of another, doth yet voluntarily put forth himſelf, and will be bound to the Creditor for him, as his Surety to anſwer for him;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66517:55"/> by reaſon of which Surety-ſhip the Creditor may come upon him, and deal with him, as he might have dealt with the principal Debtor himſelf; and this courſe we do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily take with Sureties for the recovery of our right, without any violation of juſtice. Now both theſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly applicable to the buſineſs in hand; for Jeſus Chriſt was pleaſed to Marry our Nature unto himſelf; he did partake of our fleſh and blood, and became man, and one with us: And beſides that, he did both by the Will of his Father, and his own free conſent, become our Surety, and was content to ſtand in our ſtead or room, ſo as to be made ſin and curſe for us, (that is) to have all our debts and ſorrows, all our ſins and puniſhments laid upon him; and did engage himſelf to ſatisfie God, by bearing and ſuffering, what we ſhould have born and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And therefore, although Jeſus Chriſt (abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered in himſelf) was innocent, and had no ſin inherent in himſelf, which therefore might make him lyable to Death, and Wrath, and Curſe; yet by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with us, and ſuſtaining the office of our Surety, our ſins were laid on him; and our ſins being laid upon him, he made himſelf (therefore) obnoxious, (and that juſtly) to all thoſe puniſhments which he did ſuffer for our ſins. I do confeſs, that had Chriſt been unwilling, and forced into this Surety-ſhip, or had any detriment, or prejudice riſen to any party concerned in this tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than ſome complaint might have been made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Juſtice of God. But</p>
            <p>Firſt: There was a willingneſs on all ſides for the paſſive work of Chriſt; Firſt, God the Father (who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the offended party) he was willing, which Chriſt aſſures us of, when he ſaid <hi>(Thy Will be done,)</hi> Math. 26. 42. Act. 4. 25, 26, 27, 28.) Secondly, We poor Sinners (who are the offending party) are willing. We accept of this gracious and wonderful Redemption, and bleſs the Lord, who ſo loved us, as to give his Son for us. And thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt was willing to ſuffer for us; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come,</hi> Pſal. 40. 7. <hi>And ſhall I not drink of the Cup</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:66517:55"/> 
               <hi>which my Father hath given me to drink,</hi> Joh. 18. 11. <hi>I have a Baptiſme to be Baptiſed with, and how am I ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till it be accompliſhed,</hi> Luk. 12. 50. He calls the death of his Croſs a Baptiſme, partly becauſe it was a certain immerſion into extream calamities, into which he was caſt; and partly, becauſe in the Croſs, He was ſo to be ſprinkled in his own Blood, as if he had been drowned and Baptiſed in it; the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is here rendred ſtrained, ſignifies to be pained, preſſed, or pent up, not with ſuch a grief as made him unwilling to come to it, but with ſuch as made him deſire that it were once over. <hi>There ſeems</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius) to be a ſimilitude implyed in the Original word, taken from a Woman with Child, which is ſo afraid of her bringing forth, that yet ſhe would fain be eaſed of her burden,</hi> Joh. 10. 11. <hi>I am the good Shepherd:</hi> The good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep; Chriſt is that good Shepherd by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that held not his life dear for his Sheeps ſafety, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>I lay down my life for the Sheep,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life;</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> A neceſſity there was of our Saviours death, but it was a neceſſity of immutability (becauſe God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23.) not of coaction; <hi>He laid down his life freely, He dyed willingly.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Secondly: No parties whatſoever were prejudiced or loſt by it; we loſt nothing by it, for we are ſaved by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> death, and reconciled by his death, and Chriſt loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it; ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and enter into his glory? <hi>Luk. 24. 26. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation is made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. <hi>You may ſee Chriſts glorious Rewards for his ſufferings in that,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10, 11, 12. <hi>And God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt nothing by it, for he is glorified by it; I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Joh. 17. 4. Yea, he is fully ſatisfied and repaired again in all the honour which he loſt by our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: I ſay he is now fully repaired again by the ſufferings
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66517:56"/> of Chriſt, in which he found a price ſufficient, and a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and enough to make peace for ever. In the day of account, a Chriſtians great plea is, that Chriſt has been his Surety, and paid his debts, and made up his accounts for him.</p>

O bleſſed Lord! upon my firſt believing and cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, thou didſt juſtifie me in the Court of glory, from all my ſins, both as to guilt and puniſhment. Upon my firſt act of believing, thou didſt pardon all my ſins, thou didſt forgive all my iniquities, thou did'ſt blot out all my tranſgreſſions; and as upon my firſt believing, thou didſt give me the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all my ſins, ſo upon my firſt believing thou did'ſt free me from a ſtate of Condemnation, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me in the great Salvation.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. 22.</note> for them all; he did dye, he did lay down his life, he did make his ſoul an offering for my ſins, he did become a curſe, he did endure thy infinite wrath, he did give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſatisfaction, and a full compenſation unto thy Juſtice for all my ſins, debts, treſpaſſes: This is my plea, O Lord! and by this plea I ſhall ſtand: <hi>Well,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I allow of this plea, I accept of this plea, as juſt,</hi>

               <hi>honourable, and righteous, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Seventhly: Conſider, that what ever we are bound to do, or to ſuffer by the Law of God; all that did Chriſt do, and ſuffer for us, as being our Surety and Mediator. Now the Law of God hath a double challenge or demand upon us; one is of active obedience, in fulfilling what it requires; the other is of paſſive obedience, in ſuffering that puniſhment which lies upon us, for the tranſgreſſion of it, in doing what it forbids. For as we are Created by God, we did owe unto him all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he required; and as we ſinned againſt God, we did owe unto him a ſuffering of all that puniſhment which he threatned, and we being fallen by tranſgreſſion, can neither pay the one debt, nor yet the other; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all that the Law requires. (Nay of our ſelves we can do nothing,) neither can we ſuffer, as to ſatisfie God in his Juſtice wronged by us, or to recover our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life and favour again; and therefore Jeſus Chriſt, (who was God made man) did become our Surety, and ſtood in our ſtead, or room; and he did perform what we ſhould, but could not perform; and he did bear our ſins and our ſorrows; he did ſuffer and bear for us, what we our ſelves ſhould have born and ſuffered; whereby he did fully ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and made our peace, and purchaſed life and happineſs for us. Let me a little more clearly and fully open this great truth in theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Jeſus Chriſt did perform that active obedience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unto the Law of God, which we ſhould (but by reaſon of ſin) could not perform; in which reſpect he is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>To be made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law;</hi> So far was Chriſt under the Law, as to redeem them that were under the Law. But redeem them that were under the Law, he could not, unleſs by diſcharging the bonds of the Law in force upon us; and all thoſe bonds could not be, and were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, unleſs a perfect righteouſneſs had been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66517:57"/> (on our behalf, who were under the Law) to fulfill the Law. Now there is a two-fold Righteouſneſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the actual fulfilling of the Law; one is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Righteouſneſs of the Nature of man; the other is an external Righteouſneſs of the Life or works of man: both of theſe do the Law require. The former, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. which is the ſum of the firſt Table: <hi>And thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf,</hi> which is the ſum of the ſecond Table: the latter, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> Levit. 18. 5. <hi>He that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law, to do them, is Curſed,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Now both theſe Righteouſneſſes were ſound in Chriſt; Firſt, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Heh. 7. 26. He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from ſinners,</hi> chap. 9. 14. <hi>And offered himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He knew no ſin.</hi> Secondly, External, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 22. He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> Joh. 17. 4 <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Math. 3. 15. <hi>He muſt fulfill all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Now concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts active obedience, to the Law of God theſe things are conſiderable in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt: The univerſality of it, he did whatſoever his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Father required, and left nothing of his Fathers will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; he kept the whole Law, and offended not in one point. What ever was required of us, by vertue of any Law, that he did, and fulfilled. Hence he is ſaid to be made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Subject, or obnoxious to it, to all the precepts or commands of it. Chriſt was ſo made under the Law, as thoſe were under the Law, whom he was to Redeem. Now we were under the Law, not only as obnoxious to its penalties, but as bound to all the duties of it; that this is our being under the Law, is evident by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Tell me, ye that deſire to be under the Law;</hi> ſurely it was not the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law they deſired to be under, but to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in reſpect of obedience; ſo <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 15. Here
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66517:57"/> Chriſt tell you, <hi>That it became him to fulfil all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all manner of Righteouſneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; that is, every thing that God required, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Application of that general Oxiome to the Baptiſme of <hi>John.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Secondly: The exactneſs and perfection of it. He kept the whole Law exactly; as he was not wanting in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo he did not fail in the manner of performing his Fathers Will; there was no defects, nothing lacking in his obedience; he did all things well, what we are preſſing towards, and reaching forth unto, he attained; he was perfect in every good work, and ſtood compleat in the whole will of his Father. And hence it is, that it is Recorded of him, that he was without ſin, knew no ſin, did no ſin, which could not be if he had failed in any thing. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: The conſtancy of it. Chriſt did not obey by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſits, but conſtantly; though we cannot, yet he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them. This Righteous One held on his way, he did not fail, nor was he diſcouraged; yea, when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and tribulation did ariſe againſt him, becauſe of his doing the Will of his Father, he was not offended, but did always do the things which pleaſed his Father, as he told the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 29.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: The delight that he took <hi>in doing the Will of his Father,</hi> Pſal. 40. 8. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O my God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yea, thy Law is within my heart</hi> (or in the mid'ſt of my bowels, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> runs,) by the Law of God we are to underſtand all the Commandements of God; there is not one Command which Chriſt did not delight to do. Chriſts obedience was without murmuring or grudging; his Fathers Commandements were not grievous to him; he tells his Diſciples, <hi>that it was his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to do the Will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work,</hi> John 4. 34. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: The vertue and efficacy of it, for his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his righteouſneſs never returns to him void, but it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:66517:58"/> always accompliſhes that which he pleaſes, and proſpers in the thing whereto he ordains it, and that is the making others Righteous, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>bedience of one, ſhall many be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>God made him to be ſin for us, who knew no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> and accordingly we are, <hi>for of God he is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>
            <p>The perfect, compleat Obedience of Chriſt to the Law, is certainly reckoned to us; that is an everlaſting truth: <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements,</hi> Math. 19. 17. The Commandements muſt be kept either by our ſelves, or by our Surety, or there is no entering into life; Chriſt did obey the Law, not for himſelf, but for us, and in our ſtead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>By the Righteouſneſs of one, the free-gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life; By the Obedience of one, many ſhall be made Righteons.</hi> By his Obedience to the Law, we are made Righteous; Chriſts Obedience is reckoned to us for Righteouſneſs. Chriſt, by his Obedience to the Royal Law, is made Righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. We are ſaved by that perfect Obedience, which Chriſt, when he was in this world, yeelded to the bleſſed Law of God. Mark, what ever Chriſt did as Mediator, he did it for thoſe whoſe Mediator he was; or in whoſe ſtead, and for whoſe good he executed the Office of a Mediator before God; this the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. What the Law could not do, in that it was weak, through the fleſh. God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us. The word Likeneſs, is not ſimply to be referred to fleſh, but to ſinful fleſh, as <hi>Baſil</hi> well obſerves; for Chriſt was like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted: If with our juſtification from ſin, there be joyned that active Obedience of Chriſt, which is imputed to us, We are juſt before God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that perfect form which the Law requireth.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66517:58"/> Becauſe we could not in this condition of weakneſs, whereinto we are caſt by ſin, come to God, and be freed from Condemnation by the Law, God ſent Chriſt as a Mediator to do, and ſuffer what ever the Law required at our hands; for that end and purpoſe, that we might not be condemned, but accepted of God. It was all to this end, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us; that is, which the Law required of us, conſiſting in duties of obedience, this Chriſt performed for us: This expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh;</hi> if you will add to it that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>That he was ſo ſent forth, as that he was</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>made under the Law;</hi> that is, obnoxious to it, to yield all the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it doth require, compares the whole of what Chriſt did, or ſuffered; and all this, the Holy Ghoſt tells us, was for us, <hi>verſ. 4. He that made the Law as God, was made under the Law as God-Man,</hi> whereby both the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of the Law fell upon him, 1. <hi>Paenal. 2. Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> Firſt, The paenal Obligation to undergoe the Curſe, and ſo to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice. Secondly, The prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Obligation, to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 15. This Obligation he fulfilled by doing, the other by Dying; Mark, this double Obligation could not have befallen the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, upon any natural account of his own, but upon his Mediatory account only, as he voluntarily became the Surety of this New and better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. ſo that the fruit and benefit of Chriſts voluntary ſubjection to the Law, redoundeth not at all to himſelf, <hi>but unto the perſons which were given him of the Father,</hi> Joh. 17. <hi>whoſe Sponſor he became;</hi> for their ſakes he underwent the paenal Obligation of the Law, that it might do them no harm, <hi>He being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. and for their ſakes he fulfilled the praeceptive Obligation of the Law; <hi>do this, that ſo the Law might do them good.</hi> This the Evangelical Apoſtle clearly aſſerts, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth,</hi> Romans 10. 4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the</hi>

Surely the Believer, who wanted a Righteouſneſs of his own; for ſo it follows, for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth; that is, that every poor naked Sinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus Chriſt, might have a Righteouſneſs; wherein being found, he might appear at Gods Tribunal, but his nakedneſs not appears. But as <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Elder Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſo the Believer in the Garment of his Elder Brother Jeſus, might inherit the bleſſing, even the great bleſſing of Juſtification.</p>

The Law muſt have its right before a Sinner can be ſaved; we cannot of our ſelves fulfil the right of it: But here's the comfort, Chriſt our Surety hath fulfilled it in us, and we have fulfilled it in him. Certainly, whatſoever Chriſt did concerning the Law, is ours by imputation, ſo fully, as if our ſelves had done it. <hi>Do's the Law require obedience?</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will give it. Do's the Law threaten Curſes?</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <note place="margin">Math 3 15. cap. 5, 17, 18,</note> 
               <hi>they ſhall be borne. The precept of the Law,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be kept, and the promiſes received, and the puniſhments endured, that poor Sinners may be ſaved.</hi> Our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Title to eternal life do indiſpenſably depend upon the imputation of Chriſts active obedience to us; there muſt be a perfect obeying of the Law, as the condition of life, either by the Sinner himſelf, or by his Surety, or elſe no life, which doth ſufficiently evince the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the imputation of Chriſts active obedience to us; the Sinner himſelf being altogether unable to fulfil the Law, that he may ſtand Righteous before the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God. Chriſts fulfilling of it muſt neceſſarily be im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted to him in order to righteouſneſs. There are two great things which Jeſus Chriſt did undertake for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones; the one was to make full ſatisfaction to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66517:60"/> Divine Juſtice for all their ſins. Now this he did by his Blood and Death, the other was to yield moſt abſolute conformity to the Law of God, both in nature and life; by the one, he has freed all his Redeemed ones from Hell, and by the other he has qualified all his Redeemed ones from Heaven. This is my Plea O Lord, and by this plea I ſhall ſtand. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I accept of this plea as honourable, juſt, and righteous, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly: As Jeſus Chriſt did for us, perform all that active obedience which the Law of God required; ſo he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> did alſo ſuffer all thoſe puniſhments which we had deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 22. To be made ſin for us, 1 Pet. 2. 24. Himſelf to bear our ſins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. <hi>To humble himſelf and to become obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>To be made a Curſe, an Exceration for us,</hi> Ephe. 5. 2. <hi>To give himſelf for us an Offering and Sacrifice unto God,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament; that by means of Death, for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which were called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance. Now concerning the paſſive obedience, or ſuffering of Chriſt, I would preſent unto you theſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt: That the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt were free and voluntary, and not conſtrained or forced. Auſtin ſaith, that Chriſt did ſuffer <hi>quia voluit, &amp; quando voluit, &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo voluit,</hi> Joh. 10. 17. <hi>I lay down my life,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Who gave himſelf for me.</hi> Chriſts ſufferings did riſe out of obedience to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>This Commandement have I received of my Father,</hi> and Joh. 18. 11. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> And Chriſts ſufferings did ſpring and riſe out of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66517:61"/> his love to us, <hi>who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. ſo Ephe. 5. 25. <hi>As Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> And indeed, had Chriſts ſufferings been involuntary, they could not have been a part of his obedience, much leſs could they have mounted to any thing of merit for us. Chriſt was very free and willing to undertake the work of mans Redemption; when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world, he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me; Then ſaid I,</hi>

               <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will O God,</hi> It's the expreſſion of one overjoy'd to do the Will of God; So <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 50. <hi>I have a Baptiſme to be Baptiſed with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed.</hi> There was no power, no force to compel Chriſt to lay down his life, therefore it is called the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. Nothing could fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Chriſt to the Croſs, but the golden link of his free Love. Chriſt was big of love, and therefore he freely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens all the pores of his body, that his blood may flow out from every part, as a precious Balſom to cure our wounds. The heart of Chriſt was ſo full of love, that it could not hold, but muſt needs burſt out through every part and member of his body into a bloody ſweat, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. At this time it is moſt certain, that there was no manner of violence offered to the body of Chriſt; no man touched him, or came near him with Whips or Thorns, or Spears, or Lances. Though the Night was cold, and the Ayre cold, and the Earth on which he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cold, yet ſuch a burning love he had in his breaſts to his people, as caſt him into a bloody ſweat. 'Tis certain that Chriſt never repented of his ſufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> It is a Metaphor that alludes to a Mother, who though ſhe hath had hard labour, yet doth not repent of it, when ſhe ſees a Child brought forth. So though Chriſt had hard Travel upon the Croſs, yet he doth not repent of but thinks all his ſweat and blood well beſtowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees the Man-child of Redemption is brought ſorth into the world. He ſhall be ſatisfied, the Hebrew
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66517:61"/> word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſignifies ſuch a ſatiating as a man hath at ſome ſweet repaſt, or banquet. And what do's this ſpeak out, but his freeneſs in ſuffering.</p>
            <p>But here ſome may object, and ſay, that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label> when the hour of his ſufferings drew nigh, did repent of his Suretyſhip; and in a deep paſſion, prayed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be releaſed from his ſufferings: <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> (and that three times over,) <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 39, 42, 44.</p>
            <p>Now to this Objection I ſhall Anſwer, firſt more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; <label type="milestone">

            <p>Firſt, in the general: I ſay that this earneſt prayer of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his doth not denote abſolutely his unwillingneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſets out the greatneſs of his willingneſs; for although Chriſt as a man, was of the ſame natural affections with us, and deſires, and abhorrences, of what was deſtructive to nature, and therefore did fear and deprecate that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup which he was ready to drink; yet as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Surety, and knowing it would be a Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us, (though of exceeding bitterneſs to himſelf) he did yield and lay aſide his natural reluctancies as Man, and willingly obeyed his Fathers will to drink it, as our loving Mediator, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>O Father, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becometh of me, of my natural f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was an Argument of the truth of Chriſt, his humane Nature that he naturally dreaded a diſſolution. He owed it to himſelf as a Creature, to deſire the conſervation of his being, and he could not become unnatural to himſelf, <hi>For no man ever yet hated his own Fleſh,</hi> Ephe. 5. 29. Phil. 2. 8. <hi>But being a Son, he learned ſubmiſſion, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the Croſs;</hi> that ſhameful, cruel, curſed death of the Croſs; the ſuffering whereof he owed to that ſolemn Aſtipulation, which from everlaſting paſſed between his Father and himſelf, the third perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, the Holy Ghoſt being witneſs. And therefore, though the Cup was the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cup that ever was given man to drink, as wherein there was not death only, but wrath, and curſe: Yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no other way left of ſatisfying the juſtice of his Father, and of ſaving Sinners, moſt willingly he took the Cup, and having given thanks (as it were) in thoſe words, <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it: Never did Bridegroom goe with more chearfulneſs to be Married to his Bride, than our Lord Jeſus went to his Croſs,</hi> Luk. 12. 20.</p>
            <p>Though the Cup that God the Father put into Chriſts hand, was bitter, very bitter, yea, the bittereſt that ever was put into any hand, yet he found it ſweetned with three Ingredients. 1. It was but a Cup, it was not a Sea. 2. It was his Father (and not Satan) that mingled it, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Secondly: As the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt were very free and voluntary, ſo they were very great and hainous; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what agony, what torment was our Saviour wrackt with? how deep were his wounds, how weighty his burden, how full of trembling his Cup, when he lay under the Mountains of the guilt of all the Elect? How bitter were his Tears, how painful his Sweat, how ſharp his encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how dreadful his Death? who can impute how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vials of Gods inexpreſſible, inſupportable wrath Chriſt drank off; in that 53. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> you may read of deſpiſing, rejected, ſtripes, ſmilings, wounds, ſorrows, bruiſing, chaſtiſement, oppreſſion, affliction, cutting off, putting to grief, and pouring out of his ſoul to death; all theſe put together, ſpeaks out Chriſt to be a very great ſufferer; he was a man of ſorrows, as if he were a man made up of ſorrows, (as the man of ſin, as if he were made up of ſin) as if He were nothing elſe: He knew more ſorrows than any man, yea, than all men ever did; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Chriſt Jeſus knew it, for he underwent it, his whole life was made up of ſufferings; He was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner born, but ſufferings came trooping in upon him; He was born in an Inn, yea, in a Stable, and had but a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for his Cradle. As ſoon as his Birth was noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <hi>Herod,</hi> under a pretence of worſhiping of him, had a deſign to murder him, ſo that his ſuppoſed Father was fain to flye into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſecure his life; he was perſecuted before he could (after the manner of men) be ſenſible of perſecution; and as he grew up in years, ſo his ſufferings grew up with him; Hunger and Thriſt, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Wearineſs, Scorns and Reproaches, falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Contradictions ſtill waited on him, and he had not where to lay his head, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins. This is the wonderment of Angels, the happineſs of fallen man, and the torment of Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Chriſt hath ſuffered. The Apoſtles words look like a Riddle, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, read thou if thou canſt what he hath ſuffered; as for my part they are ſo many, that in this ſhort Epiſtle I have no mind to Record them; and they are ſo grievous, that my paſſionate love won't ſuffer me to repeat them, and therefore I content my ſelf thus abruptly to deliver them. Chriſt hath ſufferd; Chriſts ſufferings were unſpeakable, His ſufferings were unutterable; and therefore the Apoſtle ſatisfies himſelf with this unperfect broken ſpeech, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered.</hi> O what woes and lamentations, what crys and exclamations, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and ſorrows, what wringing of hands, what knocking of breaſts, what weeping of eyes, what wayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tongues belong to the ſpeaking and hearing of this doleful Tragedy? Even in the Prologue I tremble, and at the firſt entrance I am as at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> that I know not with what woful geſture to act it, with what moanful voice to pronounce it, with what mournful words, with what pathetical ſpeeches, with what emphatical phraſes,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66517:63"/> with what interrupted accents, with what paſſionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate plaints to expreſs it. The multiplicity of the plot, and the variety of the acts and ſcenes is ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that my memory falls to compriſe it; the matter ſo importent, and the ſtory ſo excellent, that my tongue ſail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to declare it; the cruelty ſo ſavage, and the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre ſo barbarous, that my heart even fails to conſider it. Wherefore I muſt needs content my ſelf (with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here) to ſpeak, but unperfectly of it, and thinks this enough to ſay, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered;</hi> and well may I think this enough, for behold, what perfection there is in this ſeeming imperfect ſpeech. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſay indefinitely, he ſuffered without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of time; what is it but to ſay that he always ſuffered without exception of time? And ſo indeed the Prophet ſpeaks of him, namely, <hi>That he was a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> Iſa. 53. 3. His whole life was fill'd up with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: To ſay only he ſuffered, and nothing elſe; what is it, but to ſay, that he patiently ſuffered; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> reſiſted, never rebelled, never oppoſed? <hi>He was led as a Sheep to the ſlaughter; and as a Lamb dumb before the Sheerer, ſo opened he not his mouth,</hi> Act. 8. 32. Iſa. 53. 7. <hi>And when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 23. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: To ſay preciſely he ſuffered, and no more; what is it, but to ſay that he freely ſuffered, that he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuffered? Chriſt was under no force, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, but freely ſuffered himſelf to ſuffer, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſuffered the Jews to make him ſuffer, having power to quit himſelf from ſuffering if he had pleaſed. <hi>I lay down my life, no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again,</hi> Joh. 10. 17. But of this before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: To ſay plainly he ſuffered; what is it, but to ſay that he Innocently ſuffered, that he wrongfully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for had he been a Malefactor, or an Offender, it ſhould have been ſaid, that he was puniſhed, or that he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66517:64"/> was executed; but he was full of Innocency, he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and harmleſs; and ſo it follows in that 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. The juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: To ſay peremptorily he ſuffered, what is it but to ſay that he principally ſuffered, that he exceſſively <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſuffered: To ſay he ſuffered, What is it but to ſay he was the cheif ſufferer, the arch ſufferer? and that not only in reſpect of the manner of his ſufferings, that he ſuffered abſolutely ſo as never did any; but alſo in reſpect of the meaſure of his ſufferings, that he ſuffered exceſſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what ever any did. And thus we may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and take thoſe words, <hi>He ſuffered.</hi> That lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 12. (is very applicable to Chriſt.) <hi>Behold and ſee if there be any ſorrows like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me in the day of his fiorce anger.</hi> Now is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Apoſtle to ſay <hi>that Chriſt hath ſuffered;</hi> but will you yet ask what? But pray Friends be ſatisfied, and rather of the two, ask what not? for what ſufferings can you think of, that Chriſt did not ſuffer. Chriſt ſuffered in his Birth, and he ſuffered in his Life, and he ſuffered in his Death; he ſuffered in his Body, for he was diverſly tormented; he ſuffered in his Soul, for his Soul was heavy unto death; he ſuffered in his Eſtate, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Rayment, and he had not where to reſt his head; he ſuffered in his good Name, for he was counted a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi> a Devilliſh Sorcerer, a Wine-bibber, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. He ſuffered from Heaven, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He ſuffered from the Earth, when being hungry, the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree proved fruitleſs to him: He ſuffered from Hell, Satan aſſaulting and encountering of him, with his moſt black and horrid temptations: He began his life meanly and baſely, and was ſharply perſecuted; He continued his life poorly and diſtreſſedly, and was cruelly hated: He ended his life wofully and miſerably, and was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly tormented with Whips, Thorns, Nails, and (above
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66517:64"/> all) with the terrors of his Fathers wrath and horrors of helliſh agonies.</p>
            <p>Ego ſum qui peccavi: <hi>I am the man that have ſinned; but theſe Sheep, what have they done?</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaw the Angel deſtroying his people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. And the ſame ſpeech may every one of us take up for our ſelves, and apply to Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>I have ſinned, I have done wickedly; but this Sheep, what hath he done?</hi> yea, much more cauſe have we than <hi>David</hi> had, to take up this complaint. For</p>
            <p>Firſt: <hi>David</hi> ſaw them dye, whom he knew to be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but we ſee him dye, who (we knew) <hi>knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: <hi>David</hi> ſaw them dye a quick ſpeedy death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we ſee him dye with lingering torments; <hi>He was a dying from ſix to nine,</hi> Math. 27. 45, 46. Now in this three hours darkneſs, he was ſet upon by all the powers of darkneſs with utmoſt might and malice; but he foyled and ſpoiled them all, and made an open ſhew of them (as the Roman Conquerors uſed to do) triumphing over them on his Croſs, as on his Chariot of State, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. attended by his vanquiſhed Enemies, with their hands bound behind them, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 8. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: <hi>David</hi> ſaw them dye, who (by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> was worth ten thouſand of them; we ſee him dye for us, whoſe worth admitteth no compariſon. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: <hi>David</hi> ſaw the Lord of glory deſtroying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> mortal men; and we ſee mortal men deſtroying the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. O how much more cauſe have we then to ſay as <hi>David, I have ſinned, I have done wickedly; but this Innocent Lamb, the Lord Jeſus, what hath he done, what hath he deſerved, that he ſhould be thus greatly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Tully,</hi> though a great Orator, yet when he comes to ſpeak of the death of the Croſs, he wants words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. <hi>(Quid dicam in crucem tollere,)</hi> What ſhall I ſay of this death, ſaith he. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: As the ſufferings of Chriſt were very great, ſo the puniſhments which Chriſt did ſuffer for our ſins, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:66517:65"/> theſe were in their kinds, and parts, and degrees, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, all thoſe puniſhments which were due unto us, by reaſon of our ſins, &amp; which we our ſelves ſhould otherwiſe have ſuffered: Whatſoever we ſhould have ſuffered as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, all that did Chriſt ſuffer as our Surety and Mediator, (always excepting thoſe puniſhments which could not be endured without a pollution and guilt of ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſriſement of our peace was upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5. (And inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the puniſhments common to the nature of man, not the perſonal ariſing out of imperfection, and defect, and diſtemper. Now the puniſhments due to us for ſin, were corporal, and ſpiritual. And again, they were the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of loſs, and of ſenſe; and all theſe did Chriſt ſuffer for us, which I ſhall evidence by an induction of particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: That Chriſt ſuffered corporal puniſhments, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> moſt clear in Scripture: You read of the Injuries to his Perſon, of the Crown of Throns on his Head, of the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Cheeks, of ſpitting on his Face, of the ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Body, of the Croſs on his Back, of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in his Mouth, of the Nails in his Hands and Feet, of the Spear in his Side, and of his crucifying and dying on the Croſs, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Who himſelf, in his own body on the Tree bare our ſins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scriptures,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>And waſhed us from our ſins in his own Blood,</hi> Col. 1. 14. <hi>In whom we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Math. 26. 28. <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Chriſt ſuffered deriſion in every one of his Offices.</p>
            <p>Firſt: In his Kingly Office: They put a Scepter in his Hand, a Crown on his Head, and bowed their Knees, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews</hi> Matth. 27. 29.</p>
            <p>Secondly: In his Prieſtly Office: <hi>They put upon him a gorgeous white Robe, ſuch as the Prieſts wore,</hi> Luk. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 23. 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: In his Prophetical Office: <hi>When they had blindfolded him, Propheſie, ſay they, who it is that ſmiteth</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

            <p>And as Chriſt ſuffered in every one of his Offices, ſo he ſuffered in every member of his Body; in his Hearing by their reproaches, and crying, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> In his ſight by their Scoffings, and ſcornful geſtures. In his Smell, in his being in that noyſome place <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In his Feeling, by the Thorns on his Head, blows on his Cheeks, ſpittle on his Face, the Spear in his ſide, and the Nails in his Hands; he ſuffered in all parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body from head to foot: His Head (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a better Crown than the beſt in the world) was Crowned with Thorns, and they ſmote him on the head. <hi>Oſorius</hi> writing of the ſufferings of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>That the Crown of Throns bor'd his head with ſeventy-two wounds.</hi> To ſee that Head (before which, Angels caſt down them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and worſhiped (as I may ſay) Crowned with Throns, might well amaze us. To ſee thoſe Eyes that were purer than the Sun, put out by the darkneſs of death: To ſee thoſe Ears, which hear nothing (to ſpeak to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity) but Hallelujahs of Saints and Angels, to hear the Blaſphemies of the multitude: To ſee that Face which was fairer than the Sons of men <hi>(for being born and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without ſin, he was freed from the contagious effects of it,</hi>

To ſee that Mouth and Tongue, that ſpake as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake, accuſed for falſe Doctrines, nay Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. To ſee thoſe Hands, which freely ſwayed the Scepter of Heaven, nayled to the Croſs. To ſee thoſe Feet, <hi>like unto fine braſs,</hi> Rev. 1. 15. nayled to the Croſs for mans ſins. Who can behold Chriſt thus ſuffering in all the members of his Body, and not be ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Who can ſum up the horrible abuſes that were put upon Chriſt by his baſe Attendants. The Evangeliſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66517:66"/> tells us, that they ſpit in his Face, and buffeted him; and that others ſmote him with the palms of their hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee?</hi> Math. 26. 67, 68. And as <hi>Luke</hi> adds, <hi>many other things Blaſphemouſly ſpeak they againſt him,</hi> Luk. 22. 65. What thoſe many other things were, is not diſcovered, only ſome antient Writers ſay, <hi>That Chriſt in that night ſuffered ſo many, and ſuch hideous things, that the whole knowledge of them is reſerved only for the laſt day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Pſal. 69. 2. But that you may clearly ſee what horrible abuſes were put upon Chriſt by his Attendants: Conſider ſeriouſly of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: <hi>They ſpit in his Face,</hi> Math. 26. 67. Now this was accounted among the Jews, a matter of great infamy and reproach, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes, If her Father had ſpit in her Face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven days.</hi> Spitting in the face, among the Jews, was a ſign of anger, ſhame, and contempt, <hi>Job.</hi> 30. 10. <hi>They abhor me, they flye far from me, and ſpare not to ſpit in my Face.</hi> The face is the table of beauty or comlineſs, and when it is ſpit upon, it is made the feat of ſhame. Spitting in the face, was a ſign of the greateſt diſgrace that could be put upon a perſon; and therefore it could not but be very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Job,</hi> to ſee baſe Beggars ſpit in that Face that was wont to be honoured by Princes: But this we are not to wonder at, for there is no indignity ſo baſe and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66517:66"/> but the choiceſt Saints may meet with it, in and from this evil world. Afflicted perſons are ſacred things, and by the Laws of Nature and Nations, ſhould not be miſuſed and trampled upon, but rather pitied and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented over: But barbarous Miſcreants, when they have an opportunity, they will not ſpare to exerciſe any kind of cruelty, as you ſee by their ſpitting in the very Face of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>I hid not my Face</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſhame and ſpitting, thou I was ſairer than the Children of men,</hi> Pſal. 45. 2. <hi>yet I uſed no Mask to keep me fair, though I was white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5. 10. <hi>yet I preſerved not my Beauty from their naſty ſpittle.</hi> O that, that ſweet &amp; bleſſed Face of Jeſus Chriſt, that is ſo much honoured and adored in Heaven, ſhould ever be ſpit upon by beaſtly wretches in this world.</p>
            <p>Secondly: <hi>They ſtruck him,</hi> Joh. 18. 22. One of the Officers which ſtood by, ſtruck Jeſus with the palm of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hand, ſaying, <hi>Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo?</hi> Becauſe our Saviour gave not the High-Prieſt his uſual titles, but dealt freely with him, this impious Apparitor, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jant, to curry favour with his Maſter, ſtrikes him with his hand, with his rod ſay ſome, with his ſtick ſay others; <hi>like Maſter, like Man.</hi> O that that holy Face, which was deſigned to be the object of Heaven, in the beholding of which, much of the Celeſtial glory doth conſiſt; that that Face which the Angels ſtare upon with wonder, like Infants at a bright Sun-beam, ſhould ever be ſmitten by a baſe Varlet in the preſence of a Judge. Among all the ſufferings of Chriſt, one would think that there was no great matter in this, that a vain Officer did ſtrike him with the palme of his hand; &amp; yet if the Scriptures are conſulted, you will find that the Holy Ghoſt layes a great ſtreſs upon it. Thus <hi>Jeremy, He giveth his Check to him that ſmiteth him, he is filled full with reproach,</hi> Lam. 3. 30. Chriſt did patiently and willingly take the ſtripes that vain men did injuriouſly lay upon him; he ſuſtained all kinds of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the hands of all kinds of ungodly ones. Thus <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>They ſhall ſinite the Judg</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:66517:67"/>

By ſmiting the Judg of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a rod upon the cheek, they expreſs their ſcorn and contempt of Chriſt.

            <p>Now concerning Chriſts ſufferings on the Croſs; I ſhall only hint at a few things, and ſo cloſe up this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concerning Chriſts corporeal ſufferings; take me thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt: The death of Chriſt on the Croſs; It was a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, a ſorrowful death, a bloody death; the bitter thoughts of his ſufferings put him into a moſt dreadful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, <hi>Luk. 22. 24. Being in an agony, he prayed more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and his ſweat was as great drops of blood falling to the ground.</hi> The Greek word that is here uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a ſtriving or wreſtling againſt, as two combatants or wreſtlers do ſtrive each againſt other. The things which our Saviour ſtrove againſt, was not only the terrour of death, as other men are wont to do, (for then many Chriſtians and Martyrs might have ſeemed more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and couragious than he) but with the terrible juſtice of God, pouring out his high anger and indignation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, on the account of all the ſins of his choſen that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa</hi> 53 4, 5, 6.</note> were laid upon him, then which nothing could be more dreadful. Chriſt was in a vehement conflict in his ſoul,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66517:68"/> through the deepeſt ſenſe of his Fathers wrath againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <hi>for whom he now ſtood as a Surety and Redeemer,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. And for a cloſe of this particular, let me ſay, that Gods juſtice which we have provoked, being fully ſatisfied by the ineſtimable merit of Chriſts paſſion, is the ſureſt and higheſt ground of conſolation that we have in this world; but for the more full opinion of this bleſſed Scripture, let us take notice of theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: <hi>His ſweat was as it were blood:</hi> Some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> looks upon theſe words only as a ſimilitude, or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative hyberbole, it being a uſual kind of ſpeech to call a vehement ſweat a bloody ſweat; as he that weeps bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly is ſaid to weep tears of blood; but the moſt and beſt of the Antients underſtand the words in a literal ſenſe, and believe it was truly and properly a bloody ſweat, and with them I cloſe. But ſome will object and ſay, it was <hi>(ſicut guttae ſanguinis,)</hi> as it were drops of blood. Now to this <hi>I</hi> anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt: If the Holy-Ghoſt had only intended that <hi>ſicut</hi> for a ſimilitude or hyperbole, he would rather have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it as it were drops of nature, than as it were drops of blood; for we all know that ſweat is more like to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to blood. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: I anſwer that <hi>ſicut,</hi> as in Scripture-phraſe, doth not always denote a ſimilitude, but ſomtimes the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> very thing it ſelf, according to the verity of it. Take an inſtance or two inſtead of many: We beheld his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father; and their words ſeemed to them as it were idle tales, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them not; the words in the original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are the ſame. Certainly Chriſts ſweat in the Garden was a wonderful ſweat, not a ſweat of water, but of red gore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: He ſweat great drops of blood, clotty blood iſſuing through fleſh and skin in great abundance. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, clottered or congealed blood. There is a thin faint ſweat, and there is a thick clotted ſweat; in this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66517:68"/> ſweat of Chriſt, blood came not from him in ſmall dews, but in great drops, they were drops, and great drops of blood, craſſy and thick drops: Some read it droppings down of blood, that is blood diſtilling in greater and groſſer drops; and hence it is concluded, as preternatural; for though much may be ſaid for ſweating blood in a courſe of Nature, according to what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſt.</hi>

But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Theſe great drops of blood did not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </note> all the waters of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yea than all thoſe rivers that waters the Garden of <hi>Eden?</hi> ſo great was <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> ardor in Battel, that the blood burſt out <note place="margin">

               </note>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:66517:69"/> of his lips; but from our Champions, not lips only, but whole body burſt out a bloody ſweat: Not his eyes only were Fountains of tears, or his head waters, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> wiſhed, but his whole body was turned, as it were, into <note place="margin">Jer. 9 1.</note> Rivers of blood. A ſweet comfort to ſuch as are caſt down for that, that their ſorrow for ſin is not ſo deep and ſoaking as they could deſire.</p>
            <p>Chriſts blood is put in Scripture (by a Synecdoche of the part) for all the ſufferings which he underwent for the ſins of the Elect, eſpecially his bloody death with all its concomitants, ſo called. Firſt, Becauſe death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is violent, is joyned with the effuſion of blood: <hi>If we had lived in the days of our Fathers, we would</hi>

            <p>Secondly: As the death of Chriſt, on the Croſs, was a bitter death, a bloody death, ſo the death of Chriſt on the Croſs, was a lingring death: It was more for Chriſt to ſuffer one hour, than for us to have ſuffered for ever; but his death was lengthened out, he hung three hours on the Croſs, he dyed many deaths before he could dye one; <hi>from the ſixth hour till the nineth hour</hi> (that is, from twelve, till three in the Afternoon) <hi>there was darkneſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 27. 45.</note> 
               <hi>all the Land:</hi> About twelve when the Sun is uſually brighteſt, it began now to darken; And this darkneſs was ſo great, that it ſpread over all <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 44.</note> the Land of <hi>Jewry;</hi> yea, ſome think over all the world; ſo we tranſlate it in <hi>Luke, And there was darkneſs over all the Earth,</hi> to ſhew Gods diſlike of their horrid cruelty: He would not have the Sun give light to ſo horrid an act; the Sun as it were, hid her face,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66517:69"/> that ſhe might not ſee the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, ſo wickedly handled. It was dark: 1. To ſhew the blindneſs, darkneſs, &amp; ignorance of the <hi>Jews</hi> in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord of glory. 2. To ſhew the deteſtation of the fact. 3.

This dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not a natural Eclipſe of the Sun; for firſt it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo total, ſo general: Nor Secondly, It could not be ſo long, for the interpoſed Moon goeth ſwiftly away. Certainly this was no ordinary Eclipſe of the Sun, ſeeing the Paſſover was kept at the full Moon, when the Moon ſtands right oppoſite to the Sun on the other ſide of the Heaven, and for this cauſe cannot hinder the light of <note place="margin">Exod. 10. 12.</note> the Sun; but a ſupernatural work of God coming to paſs by Miracle, <hi>like as the darkneſs in</hi> Aegypt.

               </note> at the Suns ſetting; and therefore this Eclipſe could never be a natural Eclipſe. Many Gentiles, beſides Jews, obſerved this darkneſs as a great Miracle. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> (as <hi>ſuidas</hi> relates) could ſay at firſt ſight of it, <note place="margin">Amos 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Either the World is ending, or the God of Nature is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this darkneſs. Amos</hi> long before had Propheſied; <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that I will cauſe the Sun to go down at Noon, and I will darken the Earth in the clear day.</hi> The opinion of Authors, concerning the cauſe of this darkneſs, are various; ſome think that the Sun by Divine power, withdrew and held back its beams; others ſay, that the obſcurity was cauſed by ſome thick Clouds which were miraculouſly produced in the Ayre, and ſpread themſelves over all the Earth: Others ſay, that this darkneſs was by a wonderful interpoſition of the Moon, which at that time was at full; but by a Miracle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it ſelf betwixt the Earth and Sun. Whatſoever was the cauſe of this darkneſs, it is certain that it continued
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66517:70"/> for the ſpace of three hours as dark as the darkeſt Winter <note place="margin">Math. 27. 46.</note> Nights.</p>
            <p>About three (which the Jews call the nineth hour) the <note place="margin">John 19. 28 30.</note> Sun now beginning to receive his light, Jeſus cryed with a loud voice, <hi>Eli, Eli Lama ſabachthani, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And then that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be ſulfilled, he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt;</hi> and when he <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> had received the Vinegar, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> and at laſt, crying with a loud voyce, he ſaid, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> and having ſaid thus, he gave up the Ghoſt. Chriſts words were ever gracious, but never more gracious than at this time: You cannot find in all the books and writings of men, in all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Records of time, either ſuch ſufferings, or ſuch ſayings as were theſe laſt words and wounds; ſayings <note place="margin">John 19. 30.</note> and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt.

Chriſt was kept a great while upon the rack; it was full three hours betwixt his affixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and expiration; and certainly, it would have been longer, if he had not freely and willingly given up the Ghoſt. I have read that <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle was two whole days on the Croſs, before he dyed; and ſo long might Chriſt have been a dying, if God had not ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally heightened the degrees of his torment. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when Chriſt was on the Croſs, he felt the very pains of Hell, though not locally, yet equivalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly: As the death of Chriſt on the Croſs was a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> painful death, ſo the death of Chriſt on the Croſs was a ſhameful death. Chriſt was <hi>in medio poſitus,</hi> he hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Thieves, as if he had been the principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor. <note place="margin">Math. 27. 38.</note> Here they placed him, to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was the great ring-leader of ſuch men. Chriſt was crucified in the mid'ſt as the chief of Sinners,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66517:71"/> that we might have place in the mid'ſt of Heavenly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the one of theſe Thieves went railing to Hell, the <note place="margin">Zach. 3 7.</note> other went repenting forth right to Heaven, living long in a little time.</p>
            <p>If you ask me the names of theſe two Thieves, who <note place="margin">Q.</note> were crucified with Chriſt, I muſt anſwer, That although the Scripture nominates them not, yet ſome Writers give them theſe names, <hi>Diſmas</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It was a mighty ſhame that <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons were <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 6.</note> hanged on a Tree. O what a ſhameful death was it for Chriſt to hang on a Tree between two notorious Thieves But</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly: As the death of Chriſt was a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> death, ſo the death of Chriſt was a curſed death; <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> The death on <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> the Tree was Accurſed above all kinds of death; <hi>as the Serpent was Accurſed above all Beaſts of the field,</hi> both for <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note> the firſt tranſgreſſion; whereof the Serpent was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Tree the occaſion. Since the death of any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor might be a Monument of Gods Curſe for ſin, it may be queſtioned, why this brand is peculiarly ſet upon this kind of puniſhment; that he that is hanged, is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of God? To which I Anſwer, that the reaſon of this, was, becauſe this was eſteemed the moſt ſhameful, the moſt diſhonourable and infamous of all kinds of death, and was uſually therefore the puniſhment of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66517:72"/> thoſe that had by ſome notorious wickedneſs provoked God to pour out his wrath upon the whol Land, and ſo were hanged up to appeaſe his wrath, as we may ſee in the hanging of thoſe Princes that were guilty of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 4.</note> Whordom with the Daughters of <hi>Moab;</hi> and in the hanging of thoſe Sons of <hi>Saul</hi> in the days of <hi>David,</hi> when <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 6.</note> there was a Famine in the Land, becauſe of <hi>Sauls</hi> perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppreſſing of the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> nor was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that this kind of death was both by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and other Nations eſteemed the moſt ſhameful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; becauſe the very manner of the death did inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that ſuch men as were thus Executed, were ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable and accurſed wretches, that they did defile the Earth with treading on it, and would pollute the Earth if they ſhould dye upon it; and therefore were ſo truſſed up in the Ayre, as not fit to live amongſt men; and that others might look upon them as men made ſpectacles of Gods Indignation and Curſe, becauſe of the wickedneſs they had committed, which was not done in other kinds of death: And hence it was that the Lord God would have his Son, the Lord Chriſt, to ſuffer this kind of death; that even hence it might be the more evident, that in his death, he bare the Curſe due to our ſins, according to that of the Apoſtle. Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us; for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> The <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Chaldee</hi> tranſlateth, For becauſe he ſinned before the Lord, he is hanged.

               <hi>and to be very heavy:</hi> or we may more fully expreſs it thus, according to the original. He begun to be gaſtred with wonderſul aſtoniſhment, and to be ſatiated, filled brim full with heavineſs; a very ſad condition. All the ſins of the Elect, like a huge Army, meeting upon Chriſt, made a dreadful on-ſet on his Soul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 43, 44. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He was in an Agony.</hi> That's a conflict, in which a poor Creature wreſtles, with deadly pangs, with all his might, muſtring up all his faculties and force to grapple with them, and with-ſtand them. Thus did Chriſt ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the Indignation of the Lord, praying once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with more intenſe fervency; <hi>O that this Cup may paſs away; if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs away,</hi> while yet an <note place="margin">Luk 22 42, 43.</note> Angel ſtrengthened his outward man from utter ſinking in the conſlict. Now if this weight that Chriſt did bare, had been laid on the ſhoulders of all the Angels in Heaven, it would have ſunk them down to the loweſt Hell; it would have crackt the Axel-tree of Heaven and Earth: It made His blood ſtartle out of his body in congealed cloddered heaps: The heat of Gods fiery Indignation, made his blood to boil up till it ran over; yea, Divine wrath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted it out of its wonted Channel.

Chriſts Soul is ſorrowful; but give me that word again, his Soul is exceeding ſorrowful; but if that word be yet too low, then I muſt tell you, <hi>That his Soul was exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death:</hi> not only extenſively, ſuch as muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for the ſpace of ſeventeen or eighteen hours, even until death it ſelf ſhould finiſh it; but alſo intenſively, ſuch, and ſo great, as that which is uſed to be at the very point of death, and ſuch as were able to bring death it ſelf, had not Chriſt been reſerved to a greater and heavier pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; of this ſorrow is that eſpecially ſpoken, <hi>Behold</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lament. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> Many a ſad and ſorrowful Soul hath, no queſtion, been in the world; but the like ſorrow to this was never ſince the Creation; the very terms, or phraſes uſed by the Evangeliſts ſpeaks no leſs. He was ſorrowful and heavy ſaith one, amazed, and very heavy ſaith another; in an Agony ſaith a third; in a Soul-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaith a fourth. Certainly the bodily torments of the Croſs were much inferior to the Agony of his Soul; the pain of the body, is the body of pain: Oh but the very ſoul of ſorrow, is the Souls ſorrow; and the very ſoul of pain, is the Souls pain.</p>
            <p>Secondly: That which Chriſt aſſumed, or took of our nature, he aſſumed to this end, to ſuffer in it; and by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to ſave and redeem it. But he took the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, both body and ſoul; <hi>ergo,</hi> He ſuffered in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66517:74"/> both, firſt the aſſumption is evident, and needs no proof, that Chriſt took upon him both our ſoul and body; the Apoſtle aſſures us, where he ſaith, <hi>That in all things it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>him to be like unto us,</hi> therefore he had both body and ſoul, as we have. Secondly: Concerning the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> That, what Chriſt took of our nature, He took it by ſuffering in it properly and immediatly to Redeem us. Now this is evident by that bleſſed word, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt took part with them that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verſ. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Devil;</hi> and deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage. Hence I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, that wherein Chriſt delivered us, he took part with us in; but he delivered us from fear of death: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did therein communicate with us. Now marke, This fear was the proper and immediate paſſion of the Soul, namely, the fear of death, and God's anger. And the Text giveth this ſenſe, <hi>Becauſe the fear of this death kept them in bondage, but the ſear only of the bodily death, doth not bring us into ſuch bondage,</hi> witneſs that Song of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; That we being delivered from the hands of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould ſerve him without fear;</hi> this then is a ſpiritual fear, from the which Chriſt did deliver us: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He did communicate with us in this fear; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>In that wherein he ſuffered, and was tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Certainly that fear which fell on Chriſt, was a real fear, and it was in his Soul, and did not ariſe from the meer contemplation of bodily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, for the very Martyrs in the encountering with them have feared little. Aſſuredly there was ſome great matter that lay upon the very Soul of Chriſt, which made him ſo heavy, and ſorrowſul, and ſo afraid, and in ſuch an Agony.</p>
            <p>But if you pleaſe, take this ſecond Argument in another form of words, thus; What Chriſt took of ours, that, He in ſuffering offered up for us, (for His aſſuming of our Nature, was for this end, to ſuffer for us in our Nature,) but he took our Nature in Body and in Soul, and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66517:74"/> our ſouls as well as our bodys; and the ſins of our ſouls did need his Sacrifice, as well as the ſins of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys; and our ſouls were Crucified with Chriſt as well as our bodys. <hi>Mens mea in Chriſto Cruciſixa eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> Surely, if our whole man was loſt, then our whole man did need the benefit and help of a whole Saviour; and if Chriſt had aſſumed only our fleſh, our body, then our ſouls adjudged, adjudged to puniſhment, had remained under tranſgreſſion without hope of pardon. Several ſayings of the Ancients doth further ſtrengthen this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, take a taſt of ſome. <hi>Si totus homo periit, totus bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>That there is a kind of dying in the ſoul, when it is pierced with grief, beſides the death of the ſoul, either by ſin or damnation is not diſagreeing to the Scripture. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the ſoul is ſaid to be Crucified, as is evident by that paſſage of the Apoſtle; <hi>I am Crucified to the World,</hi> when as yet his body was alive.

            <p>Secondly: For the Aſſumption. 1. Howſoever it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> admitted that the body is the inſtrument of the ſoul, both in ſinning and ſuffering, yet the concluſion is this, That becauſe ſin is committed in the ſoul principally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, therefore the ſatisfaction muſt be made in the ſoul principally and properly: If this concluſion be granted, we have that we would; for the bodily pains affecting the ſoul, are not the proper paſſions of the ſoul, neither is the ſoul ſaid to ſuffer properly, when the body ſuffereth, but by way of compaſſion and conſent. 2. We grant that in the proper and immediate ſufferings of the ſoul, the body alſo is affected: As when Chriſt was in his Agony in the Garden, his whole body was therewith ſtirred and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> and that it did ſweat drops of blood: But it is one thing when the grief beginneth immediatly in the ſoul, and ſo affecteth the body, and when the pain is firſt infli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body, and ſo worketh upon the ſoul, there the ſoul ſuffereth properly and principally, of which ſufferings we ſpeak here neither properly nor principally, which is not the thing in queſtion. 3. It is not the reaſonable ſoul that is affected with the body, for it is a ground in Philoſophy (that the ſoul ſuffereth not) but only the ſenſitive part: But the grief that we ſpeak of, that is ſatisfactory for ſin, muſt be in the very reaſonable ſoul, where ſin took the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſo <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith upon thoſe words of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Ambroſe de Incarnat. cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>My Soul is heavy to death; Ad rationabilis aſſumptionem</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:66517:76"/> 
               <hi>animae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>naturae humanae refertur affectum:</hi> It is referred to the aſſumption of the reaſonable ſoul, and humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Pride, Ambition, Infidelity began in <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul, and had their determination there; in the committing of thoſe ſins, the body had no part; indeed with the ear, they heard the ſuggeſtion of Satan; but it was no ſin, till in their minds they had conſented unto it: Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt ſin committed, was properly and wholly in the ſoul, for the ſame the ſoul muſt properly and wholly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.</p>
            <p>Becauſe ſin took beginning from <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction alſo muſt begin in Chriſts Soul, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Inciplo in Chriſto vincere, unde in</hi> Adam <hi>victus ſum.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ambroſe. lib 4. <hi>in</hi> Luc.</note> I begin there to win in Chriſt, where in <hi>Adam</hi> I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Then it followeth, that the ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul took beginning there, and were not derived by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy from the ſtripes and pain of the body. We infer then, that therefore Chriſts Soul had proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſufferings, beſides thoſe which proceeded from ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with his body, and all Chriſts ſufferings were ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt did ſatisfie for our ſins properly and immediatly in his ſoul.</p>
            <p>But if you pleaſe, take this fourth Argument in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form of words, thus, The puniſhment which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> (our firſt Surety) and in him againſt us; that ſame did Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> (our next and beſt Surety) bear for us, (or elſe it muſt ſtill lye upon us to ſuffer it.) But the puniſhment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and denounced againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> for tranſgreſſion, was not only corporal, reſpecting our bodyes, but ſpiritual alſo, reſpecting our ſouls. There was a ſpiritual malediction due unto our ſouls, as well as a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look as God put a Sanction on the Law and Covenant of works made with all of us in <hi>Adam,</hi> that he and his ſhould be liable to death, both of body and ſoul (which Covenant being broken by ſin, all Sinners became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66517:76"/> to the death both of body and ſoul) ſo it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Redeemed ſhould be delivered from the death of both, by the Redeemers taſting of death in both kinds, as much as ſhould be ſufficient for their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Sirs, as ſin infected the whole Man, ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Curſe following on ſin, left no part nor power of the mans ſoul free; ſo Juſtice required that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, coming in the room of the perſons Redeemed, ſhould feel the force of the Curſe both in body and ſoul. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly: <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> Iſa. 53. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Here the ſoul is taken properly, and the travel of Chriſts ſoul is his ſufferings; for it follows, <hi>And he ſhall bear their Iniquities.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Sixthly: <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for his peoples ſins,</hi> Gal. 1. 9. <note place="margin">6. Ephe. 5. 25. 1 Tim. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Who gave himſelf for our ſins,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might Redeem us from all Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. but the body only is not himſelf, <hi>ergo;</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Phil. 2. 7. Chriſtus <gap reason="foreign">

Hence we conclude, that if Chriſt were exhauſt upon the Croſs, if nothing was left him; that he ſuffered in body and ſoul; that there was no part within or without free from the Croſs, but all was emptied and poured out for our Redemption.</p>
            <p>Again: We read <hi>That Chriſt, through the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14</note> 
               <hi>offered himſelf to God;</hi> Whatſoever was in Chriſt, did either offer, or was offered; His eternal Spirit only did offer, <hi>ergo,</hi> His whole humane Nature, both Body and Soul was offered. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> witneſſeth in theſe words, <note place="margin">Origen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> batillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnis humanae,</hi> &amp;c. See how our true Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt, taking the cenſor of his humane fleſh, putting to the fire of the Altar; that is, His magnificent Soul; wherewith he was born in the fleſh; and adding Incenſe, that is, an
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66517:77"/> immaculate Spirit, ſtood in the middeſt between the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and the dead. Thus you ſee that he makes Chriſts ſoul a part in the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly: Chriſts love unto man, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, was in the higheſt degree, and greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that could be; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>What could I have done any more for my Vineyard, that I have not done unto it?</hi> But if Chriſt had given his Body only, and not his Soul for us, he had not done for us all he could, and ſo his love ſhould have been greatly empaired and diminiſhed; <hi>ergo,</hi> He gave his Soul alſo together with his Body, to be the full price of our Redemption; and certainly, the travail and labour of Chriſts Soul was moſt acceptable unto God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>Therefore I will give him a Portion with</hi>

               <hi>the great, becauſe he hath poured out his Soul unto death,</hi> &amp;c. and bare the ſins of many. Doubtleſs, the ſufferings of Chriſt in his Soul (together with his Body) doth moſt fully and amply commend and ſet forth Gods great love to poor Sinners. Before I cloſe up this particular, take a few Teſtimonies of the Fathers, which do witneſs with us for the ſufferings of Chriſt, both in Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath taken off us, that which he ſhould offer as <note place="margin">Ambroſe. de Incarnat. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> proper for us, to Redeem us; and whatſoever Chriſt took off us, he offered; <hi>ergo,</hi> He offered Body and Soul, for he took both.</p>

If Chriſt then did take and bare all the paſſions of the ſoul, without ſin, then the proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate grief and anguiſh thereof, and not the compaſſion only with the body. To theſe let me add the conſent of the reformed Churches; <hi>French Confeſ.</hi> Chriſt did ſuffer <note place="margin">Harm p. 59.

            </p>
            <p>Now the Teſtimonies of the Fathers, and the conſent of the reformed Churches, affirming the ſame, that Chriſt was Crucified in his ſoul, and that he gave his ſoul a price of Redemption for our ſouls: Who can then doubt of this, but that Chriſt verily, properly, immediately ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſoul, in all the proper paſſions thereof, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured pains and torments in his fleſh; and if you pleaſe, this may go for an eighth argument to prove that Chriſt ſuffered in his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Secondly: That the ſufferings of Chriſt in his ſoul, were very high, and great, and wonderful, both as to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of loſs, and as to the puniſhment of ſenſe; all which <hi>I</hi> ſhall make evident in theſe four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>Firſt: That Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer dereliction, of God really; that he was indeed deſerted &amp; <note n="†" place="margin">Forſaken, 1. By denying of protection. 2.

That <hi>I</hi> do not mean that there was nay ſuch deſertion of Chriſt, by God, as did deſolve the union of the Natures in the perſon of Chriſt. (For Chriſt in all his ſufferings ſtill remained God and Man.) Nor 2. Do I mean an abſolute deſertion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the preſence of God. (For God was ſtill preſent with Chriſt in all his ſufferings, and the God-head did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Humanity in, and under his ſufferings) but that which <hi>I</hi> mean, is this. That as to the ſenſible and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting manifeſtations of Gods preſence, thus he was for a time left and forſaken of God; God for a time had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-away all ſenſible conſolation, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this deſertion, Chriſt is not to be looked upon ſimply, as he is in his own perſon the Son of the Father, in whom he is always well pleaſed, but as he ſtandeth in the room of Sinners, Surety and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, <note place="margin">

There is between Chriſt and God. 1. An eternal Union natural of the perſon. 2. Of the God-head and Man-hood. 3. Of Grace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: In this laſt ſenſe, he means forſaken, according to his feeling: Hence he ſaid, <hi>Not my Father, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but my God, my God;</hi> which words, are not words of complaining, but words expreſſing his grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

If Chriſt were truly forſaken of God, it would follow that the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union was diſſolved, and that Chriſt was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſeparated from God, for otherwiſe he could not be forſaken.</p>
            <p>To what he objects, we thus reply firſt. If Chriſt had been totally and eternally forſaken, the perſonal union muſt have been diſſolved; but upon this temporal and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial rejection, or dereliction, there followeth not a perſonal diſſolution, or general dereliction: But ſecondly: As the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, being without life, was ſtill Hypoſtatically united to the God-head, ſo was the ſoul of Chriſt, though for a time, without feeling of his favour; the dereliction of the one, doth no more diſſolve the Hypoſtatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the death of the other. If life went from the body, and yet the Deity was not ſeparated in the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſecration, but only ſuſpended in operation. So the feeling of Gods favour, which is the life of the ſoul, might be intermitted in Chriſt, and yet the Divine Union not diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth well ſhew how this may be <note place="margin">Auguſt, <hi>lib</hi> de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66517:79"/> though the operation thereof be deferred; ſo in Chriſts ſleep upon the Croſs, the God-head was not ſeparated, though the working power thereof were for a time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred. Look as the Elect Members of Chriſt may be forſaken, though not totally or finally; but <hi>ex parte</hi> in part, and for a time, and yet their Election remain firm ſtill; the ſame may be the caſe of our head, that he was <hi>ex parte de relictus;</hi> only in part forſaken, and for a time always beloved for his own Innocency, but for us and in our perſon, as our pledg and Surety, deſerted.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of dereliction, or forſaking; one is for a time, and in part, ſo the Elect may be, and ſo Chriſt was forſaken upon the Croſs; another which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, final, and general; and ſo neither Chriſt nor his Members never was, nor never ſhall be forſaken. Chriſt in the deepeſt anguiſh of his ſoul is upheld and ſuſtained by his Faith, <hi>My God, my God;</hi> whereby he ſheweth his ſingular confidence and truſt in God, notwithſtanding the preſent ſenſe of his wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how can Chriſt be forſaken of God himſelf, being God;</hi>

               <hi>for the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt are all three but one and the ſame God?</hi> Yea, <hi>How can he be forſaken of God, ſeeing he is the Son of God? and if the Lord leave not his Children, which hope and truſt in him, how can he forſake Chriſt his only begotten Son, who depended upon him and his mighty power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt: By God, here we are to underſtand God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> the firſt perſon of the bleſſed Trinity; according to the vulgar and common rule, when God is compared with the Son or Holy-Ghoſt, then the Father is meant by this title God; not that the Father is more God than the Son, for in dignity all the Three Perſons are equal, but they are diſtinguiſhed in order only; and thus the Father is the firſt Perſon, the Son the Second, and the Holy-Ghoſt the Third.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Our Saviours complaint, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> muſt be underſtood in regard of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not of his God-head; although the God-head
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66517:79"/> and Man-hood were never ſevered from the firſt time of his Incarnation, but the God-head of Chriſt; and ſo the God-head of the Father did not ſhew forth his power in his Man-hood, but did as it were lye a ſleep for a time, that the Man-hood might ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Chriſt was not indeed utterly forſaken of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> God, in regard of his humane Nature, but only as it were forſaken; that is, Although there were ſome few minutes and moments, in which he received no ſenſible conſolations from the Deity; yet that he was not utterly forſaken, is moſt clear from this place, where he flees unto the Lord, as unto his God, <hi>My God, my God;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from his Reſurrection the third day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: Divines ſay, that there are ſix kinds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> or forſakings: 1. By diſ-union of perſon; and 2. By loſs of grace; and 3. By diminution and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of grace: and 4. By want of aſſurance of future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and preſent ſupport; and 5. By denial of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and 6. By withdrawing of all ſolace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Now it is fooliſh and impious to think that Chriſt was forſaken any of the firſt four ways; for the unity of his perſon was never diſſolved, his graces were never ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken away, or diminiſhed; neither was it poſſible that he ſhould want Aſſurance of future deliverance and preſent ſupport, that was Eternal God, and Lord of Life; but the two laſt ways he may rightly be ſaid to have been forſaken, in that his Father denied to protect and keep him out of the hands of his cruel, bloody, and mercileſs Enemies; no ways reſtraining them, but ſuffering them to do the uttermoſt that their wicked hearts could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and left him to endure the extremity of their fury and malice; and that nothing might be wanting to make his ſorrows beyond meaſure ſorrowful, withdrew from him that ſolace and comfort that he was wont to find in God; and removed far from him all things for a little time, that might any way leſſen and aſſwage the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his pain.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:66517:80"/>
            <p>Secondly: That Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the wrath of God which was due unto us for our ſins. The Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4. ſaith, <hi>That he was plagued and ſmitten of God;</hi> and ver. 5. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him.</hi> To be plagued and ſmitten of God, is to feel and ſuffer the ſtroak of his wrath: And ſo to be chaſtified of God, as to make peace with God, or to appeaſe him, is ſo to ſuffer the wrath of God, as to ſatisfie God, and to remove it. And truly, how Chriſt ſhould poſſibly eſcape the feeling of the wrath of God, incenſed againſt our ſins, he ſtanding as a Surety for us, with our ſins laid upon him, and for them fully to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, is not Chriſtianly, or rationally imaginable.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome do object, that Chriſt was always the beloved of his Father, and therefore could never be the object of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: By diſtinguiſhing of the perſon of Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> whom his Father always loved, and as ſuſtaining our ſins, and in our room ſtanding to ſatisfie the juſtice of God; and as ſo, the wrath of God fell upon him, and he bore it, and ſo ſatisfied the juſtice of God, that we thereby are now delivered from wrath through him. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Much more being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath by him:</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 10. <hi>And to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus which deliverod us from the wrath to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a groundleſs conceit of ſome learned heads, who deny the cauſe of Chriſts Agony, to be the drinking of that Cup of wrath that was given to him by his Father; ſaying, <hi>That the ſight of it only, and of the peril he ſaw we were in, was the cauſe of his Agony;</hi> for the Cup was not <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 11.</note> only ſhew'd unto him, and the great wrath, due to our ſins ſet before him, that he ſhould ſee it, and tremble at the apprehenſion of the danger we were in, but it was poured not only on him, but into him; that he for the ſins of his Redeemed Ones ſhould ſuffer it ſenſibly, and drink it, that the bitterneſs thereof might affect all the powers of his ſoul and body: for the Scripture do's ſufficiently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66517:80"/> teſtifie, that not only upon the ſight and apprehenſion of this wrath and curſe coming on him, the holy humane <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7.</note> Nature did holily abhor it; but alſo that he ſubmitted to receive it upon the conſideration of the divine decree and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 38, 39, 42, 44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. cap. 7. 23.</note> agreement made upon the price to be paid by him, and that upon the feeling of this wrath, this Agony in his ſoul, and bloody ſweat of his body was brought on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how could the pourings forth of the Fathers wrath, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>on his innocent and dear Son, conſiſt with his Fatherly love to him,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Even as the innocency and holineſs of Chriſt could well <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> conſiſt with his taking upon him the puniſhment of our ſins; for even the wrath of a juſt man, inflicting capital puniſhment on a condemned perſon, (put caſe it be his own Child) can well conſiſt with Fatherly affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Child ſuffering puniſhment. Did you never ſee a Father weep over ſuch a Son that he has corrected moſt ſeverely? Did you never ſee a Judge ſhed tears for thoſe very perſons that he has Condemned? There is no doubt but wrath and love can well conſiſt in God, in whom affections do not war one with another, nor fight with reaſon, as it often falls among men; for the affections aſcribed unto God, are effects rather of his holy will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, than properly called affections in him; and theſe effects of Gods will about us, do always tend to our happineſs and bleſſedneſs at laſt, how-ever they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe one from another in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: That Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> torments of Hell, though not after a Helliſh manner. <hi>I</hi> readily grant that Jeſus Chriſt did not locally deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, to ſuffer there amongſt the damned, neither did he ſuffer Helliſh darkneſs, nor the flames of Hell, nor the Worm that never dyes, nor final deſpair, nor guilt of Conſcience, nor gnaſhing of teeth, nor impatient indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor eternal ſeparation from God; theſe things were abſolutely inconſiſtent with the holineſs, purity, and dignity of his perſon, and with the office of a Mediator and Redeemer. But yet <hi>I</hi> ſay that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66517:81"/> did ſuffer in his Soul for our ſins ſuch pain, horror, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, agony, and conſternation, as amounted unto <hi>crucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus infernales,</hi> and are in Scripture called <hi>The ſorrows of Hell. The ſorrows of Hell did compaſs me about,</hi> (or the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 5.</note> cords of Hell did compaſs me about, ſuch as wherewith they bind Malefactors when they are led forth to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) Now theſe ſorrows, theſe cords of Hell, were the things that extorted from him that paſſionate expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 46.</note> Chriſts ſufferings were unſpeakable, and ſomewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the pains of Hell. Hence the Greek Letany, <hi>By thine unknown ſufferings, good Lord deliver us. Funinus</hi> an Italian Martyr, being asked by one, why he was ſo <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Rom. and</hi> Mon. <hi>fol.</hi> 853.</note> merry at his death, ſith Chriſt himſelf was ſo ſorrowful; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſuſtained in his ſoul, all the ſorrows and conflicts with Hell and death due to us;</hi> by whoſe ſufferings we are delivered from ſorrow and the fear of them all. It was a great ſaying of a very learned man, that ſetting Iniquity and Eternity of puniſhment aſide (which Chriſt might not ſuſtain) Chriſt did more vehemently and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel the wrath of God, then ever any man did or ſhall, no not any perſon reprobated and damned excepted; and certainly, the reaſon annexed, to prove this expreſſion, is very weighty, becauſe all the wrath, that was due for all the ſins of the Elect (all whoſe ſins were laid on Chriſt) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6.</note> was greater than the wrath which belonged to any one ſinner, though damned for his perſonal ſinning: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, if you do ſeriouſly conſider thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt in his Agony, in the Garden, you may (by them) conjecture what helliſh torments Chriſt did ſuffer for us. In that Agony of his, he was afraid, and amazed, and fell <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 14. 33. <hi>verſ.</hi> 34.</note> flat on the ground: He began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy; and ſaith unto them, <hi>My ſoul is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorowful unto death;</hi> and his ſweat was as it were great <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk</hi> 22. 44.</note> drops of blood falling down to the ground: He did ſweat clotted blood, to ſuch abundance, that it ſtreamed through his apparel, and did wet the ground; which dreadful Agony of Chriſt, how it could ariſe from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66517:81"/> cauſe than the ſenſe of the wrath of God, parallel to that in Hell <hi>I</hi> know not.</p>
            <p>Orthodox Divines do generally take Chriſts ſufferings in his ſoul, and the detaining his body in the grave (put in as the cloſe and laſt part of Chriſts ſufferings) as the true meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>He deſcended into Hell;</hi> not only becauſe theſe pains which Chriſt ſuffered both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul, were due to us in full meaſure, but alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which Chriſt in point of torment and vexation ſuffered was in ſome reſpect of the ſame kind with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned. For the clearing of this, conſider, that in the puniſhment of the damned, there are theſe three things. 1 The perverſe diſpoſition of the mind of the damned in their ſufferings. 2. The duration and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of their puniſhment. And 3. The puniſhment it ſelf, tormenting ſoul and body: Of theſe three, the firſt two could have no place in Chriſt: Not the firſt, Becauſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. ult.</note> he willingly offered himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreement paid the Ranſom fully: Not the ſecond, Becauſe he could no longer be held under ſorrows and ſufferings, than he had ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, and paid the price that he was to lay down. And his infinit excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and glory made his ſhort ſufferings to be of infinit worth, and equivalent to our everlaſting ſufferings. The third then only remaineth, which was the real and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments of his ſoul and body, which he did really feel and experience when he was upon the Croſs. O Sirs, What need you queſtion Chriſts undergoing of Helliſh pains, when all the pains, torments, curſe, and wrath, which was due to the Elect, did fall on Chriſt, and lye on Chriſt, till Divine Juſtice was fully ſatisfied. Though Chriſt did not ſuffer eternal death for ſinners, yet he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that which was equivalent, and therefore the juſtice of God is by his death wholly appeaſed.</p>
            <p>It is good ſeriouſly to ponder upon theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>The ſorrows of Hell did compaſs me about,</hi> Pſal. 88. 3. <hi>My ſoul is filled with evil, and my life draweth near to Hell,</hi> Pſal. 86. 13. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my Soul from the</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:66517:82"/> 
               <hi>nethermoſt Hell.</hi> In theſe places the Prophet ſpeaks in the perſon of Chriſt; and the Papiſts themſelves do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the Hebrew word <hi>Sheol,</hi> that is here uſed, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Hell properly, and not for the Grave; therefore theſe places do ſtrongly conclude for the helliſh ſorrows or ſufferings of Chriſt. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell.</hi> If Chriſts ſoul be not left or forſaken in Hell, yet it follows, it was in Hell; not that Chriſt did feel the ſorrows of Hell, after death, but that he did feel the very ſorrows of Hell in his ſoul while he lived. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the whole puniſhment of body and ſoul which was due unto us, Chriſt our Redeemer was in general to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and ſatisfie for in his own perſon; but the torments and terrors of Hell, and the vehement ſenſe of Gods wrath, are that puniſhment which did belong to the ſoul; <hi>ergo,</hi> Chriſt did ſuffer the torments and terrors of Hell: By the whole puniſhment, you are to underſtand the whole kind or ſubſtance of the puniſhment, not all the circumſtances; and the very ſame manner, the whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, then is the whole kind of puniſhment; that is, in body and ſoul, which Chriſt ought to have ſuffered, though not in the ſame manner and circumſtance. 1. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the place of Hell Locally: Nor 2. For the time Eternally: Nor 3. For the manner Sinfully. When we ſay Chriſt was to ſuffer our whole puniſhment, all ſuch puniſhments as cannot be ſuffered without ſin, as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, final reprobation are manifeſtly excepted. Chriſt did bear all our puniſhment, though not as we ſhould have borne it; that is, 1. Sinfully. 2. Eternally. 3. Helliſhly: But he did ſo bear all our puniſhment, as to finiſh all upon the Croſs; and in ſuch ſort as Gods juſtice <note place="margin">2 <hi>Col</hi> 14. 15.</note> was ſatisfied, his Perſon not diſgraced, nor his Holineſs defiled, and yet mans Salvation fully perfected. We <note place="margin">

                     </gap>b.</hi> 9. 4 cap. 10. 15.</note> conſtantly affirm that Chriſt did ſuffer the pains of Hell in his Soul, with theſe three reſtrictions. 1. That there be neither indignity offered to his Royal Perſon. 2. Nor injury to his Holy Nature. 3. Nor impoſſibility to his glorious work: All ſuch pains of Hell then as Chriſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66517:82"/> might have ſuffered: 1. His Perſon not diſhonoured. 2. His Nature with ſin not defiled. 3. His work of our Redemption not hindered, we do ſtedfaſtly believe were ſuſtained by our Bleſſed Saviour. Conſider a few things.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Conſider the adjuncts of Hell, which are theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> four. 1. The place which is Infernal. 2. The time which is Perpetual. 3. The darkneſs which is unſpeakable. 4. The Miniſters and Torments; the Spirits and Devils which are irreconcileable. Now theſe adjuncts of Hell Chriſt is freed from, for the dignity of his perſon; it was not fit that the Son of God, the Heir of Heaven, ſhould be ſhut up in Hell, or that he ſhould for ever be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, who is never from Gods preſence ſequeſtred, or that the light of the world ſhould be cloſed up in darkneſs, or that he who bindeth the evil Spirits, ſhould be bound by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Secondly: Conſider the effects (or rather the defects) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Hell, which are chiefly theſe two. Firſt: The depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all vertue, grace, holineſs. Secondly: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poſſeſſion of all Vice, Impiety, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the neceſſity of the work of Chriſt doth exempt him from theſe effects; for if he had been either void of grace, or poſſeſſed with vice, he could not have been the Redeemer of poor loſt ſouls; for the want of Vertue he could not have Redeemed others; for the preſence of ſin he ſhould have been Redeemed himſelf; and from fretting Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and fearful Deſperation, the piety and ſanctity of his Nature doth preſerve him; who being without ſin, could neither by Indignation diſpleaſe his Father, nor by Deſperation deſtroy himſelf. So that if you conſider ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the adjuncts of Hell, or the effects, then I ſay we do remove all them as far off from the holy ſoul of Chriſt, as Heaven is from Hell, or the Eaſt from the Weſt, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66517:83"/> the whole puniſhment of body and ſoul in general, that was due unto us, for the ſame which we ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, if he had not ſatisfied for it; and ſo conſequently we affirm, that he felt the anguiſh of ſoul, and horror of Gods wrath, and ſo in ſoul entred into the torments of Hell for us, ſuſtained them, and vanquiſhed them: One ſpaking in honour of Chriſts paſſion, ſaith, <hi>Cum iram Dei</hi>

O Sirs, this we need not fear to confeſs, that Chriſt bearing our ſins in himſelf, upon the Croſs, did feel himſelf, during that combat, as rejected and forſaken of God, and accurſed for us, and the flames of his Fathers wrath burning within him; ſo that to the honour of Chriſts Paſſion, we confeſs that our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer refuſed no part of our puniſhment, but endured the very pains of Hell ſo far, as they tended not, neither to the derogation of his Perſon, deprivation of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſtruction of his Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Here it may be query'd whether the Lord Jeſus Chriſt underwent the <hi>idem,</hi> the very ſelf-ſame puniſhment that we ſhould have undergone? or only the <hi>tantundem,</hi> that which did amount, and was equivalent thereunto? To which, I Anſwer, That in different reſpects, both may be affirmed. The puniſhment which Chriſt indur'd, if it be conſidered in its ſubſtance, kind, or nature, ſo 'twas the ſame with that the Sinner himſelf ſhould have undergone; but if it be conſidered with reſpect to certain circumſtances, adjuncts, or accidents, which attend that puniſhment, (as inflicted upon the Sinner) ſo 'twas but equivalent and not the ſame. The puniſhment due to the Sinner, was death, the curſe of the Law (upon the breach of the firſt Covenant,) now this Chriſt underwent, <hi>For</hi>

               <hi>he was made a Curſe for us.</hi> The adjuncts attending this death, were the Eternity of it, Deſperation going along with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Chriſt was freed from (the dignity of his Perſon ſupplying the former, the ſanctity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſecuring him againſt the latter;) therefore in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto theſe (and to ſome other things already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) it was but the <hi>tantundem,</hi> not the <hi>idem;</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there had been nothing of ſameneſs, nothing beyond equivalency in what Chriſt ſuffered; yet that was enough, for it was not required that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer every kind of Curſe, which is the effect of ſin, but in the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death. Look as in his fulfilling of the Law for us, it was not neceſſary that he ſhould perform every holy duty that the Law requireth; for he could not perform that obedience which Magiſtrates, or Married perſons are bound to do: Its enough that there was a fulfilling of it in the general for us. So here it was not neceſſary that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould undergo in every reſpect the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which the offender himſelf was lyable unto; but if he ſhall undergoe ſo much as may ſatisfie the Laws threatnings, and vindicate the Law-giver in his Truth, Juſtice, and Righteous government, that was enough.

The perſon dying was God, elſe his perſon could have done us no good.

            <p>O Sirs, you muſt ſeriouſly conſider, that though Chriſt as God, in his God-head could not ſuffer in a phyſical ſenſe, yet in a moral ſenſe he might ſuffer, and did ſuffer: For he being in the form of God, thought it not robbery <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8.</note> to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of men; and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. O! who can ſum up the contradictions, the railings, the revilings, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, the deſpiſings and calumnies that Chriſt met with from Sinners, yea from the worſt of Sinners.</p>

               </label> proper to either of the two Natures, from thoſe things which are aſcribed to his Perſon, in reſpect of either of the Natures, or both the Natures; for infirmity, phyſical ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, or mortality, are proper to the humane Nature. The glory of power, and grace, and mercy, and ſuper-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, and ſuch like, are proper to the Diety; but the ſufferings of the humane Nature, are ſo far from diminiſhing the glory of the divine Nature, that they do manifeſt the ſame, and make it appear more clearly and gloriouſly, for by how much the humane Nature was weakned, depreſſed, and deſpiſed for our ſins, for our ſakes, by ſo much the more the love of Chriſt, God and Man in one perſon toward man, and his mercy, and power, and grace to man, do ſhine in the eyes of all that judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do look upon him.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> theſe things muſt be premiſed. Firſt, That the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſorrows and ſufferings of Hell be no otherwiſe attributed to Chriſt, than as they may ſtand with the dignity and worthineſs of his Perſon, the holineſs of his Nature, and the performance of the office and work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt then for the ſoul of Chriſt to ſuffer in the local place of Hell, to remain in the darkneſs thereof, and to be tormented with the material flames there, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to be damned, was not for the dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom for his excellency and worthineſs, both the place, manner, and time of thoſe torments were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Final Rejection and Deſperation, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and the worm of Conſcience agreeth not with the holineſs of his Nature, <hi>Who was a Lamb without a ſpot,</hi> and therefore we do not, we dare not aſcribe them to him. <note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly: Deſtruction of body and ſoul, which is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſecond death, could not fall upon Chriſt; for this were to have deſtroyed the work of our Redemption, if he had been ſubject to deſtruction. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly: Blaſphemy and Deſpair are no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> parts of the pains of the damned, but the conſequents, and follow the ſenſe of Gods wrath in a ſinful Creature that is overcome by it. But Chriſt had no ſin of his own, neither was he overcome of wrath, and therefore he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 9. 11.</note> held faſt his integrity and innocency. Deſpair is an unavoidable Companion, attending the pains of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, as all Reprobates do experience. Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an utter hopeleſneſs of any good, and a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and waiting on the worſt that can befall; and this is the lot and portion of the damned in Hell.

Yet a man that is grown up, may groundedly hope to eſcape out of a far more deep and dangerous place, becauſe by reaſon of his ſtature, ſtrength, and skill, he could wade or ſwim out.

But</p>
            <p>Secondly: If Chriſt did go into the place of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> then he went either in ſoul, or in body, or in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; not in his God-head, for that could not deſcend, becauſe it is every where, and his body was in the grave; and as for his ſoul, it went not to Hell, but immediatly after his death, it went to Paradiſe, that is the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a place of joy and happineſs; <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> which words of Chriſt muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly: When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>me in Paradiſe,</hi> He doth intimate (as ſome obſerve) a reſemblance which is between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> quickly ſinned againſt God, and was as <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly: 'Tis not impoſſible that the pains of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> death ſhould be ſuffered in this life, time, and place, are but circumſtances; the main ſubſtance of the ſecond death, is the bearing of Gods fierce wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

It is not poſſible for any neither to be at once, nor yet at ſundry times ſucceſſively, for there is no paſſing from Heaven to Hell, or from Hell to Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 26. The place of ſuffering, is but a circumſtance in the buſineſs; Hell (the place of the damned) is no part of the debt, therefore neither is ſuffering there locally any part of the payment of it, no more than a Priſon is any part of an earthly debt, or of the payment of it. The Surety may ſatisfie the Creditor in the place appointed for payment, or in the open Court, which being done, the Debtor and Surety both are acquitted, that they need not go to Priſon; if either of them go to Priſon, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not, or cannot pay the debt; for all that Juſtice requires, is to ſatisfie the debt, to the which, the Priſon is meerly extrinſical: Even ſo the Juſtice of God cannot be ſatisfied for the tranſgreſſion of the Law, but by the death of the Sinner; but it doth not require that this ſhould be done in the place of the damned. The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66517:87"/> wicked go to Priſon, becauſe they do not, they cannot make ſatisfaction; otherwiſe Chriſt having fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the debt, needed not go to Priſon.</p>

                  <hi>Math.</hi> 18 28. 35.</note> ever kept in Priſon. Look as eternal death hath in it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; deſpair neceſſarily in all thoſe that ſo die, ſo Chriſt could not ſuffer, but what was wanting in duration was ſupplyed; 1. By the immenſity of his ſorrows conflicting with the ſenſe of Gods wrath, becauſe of our ſins imputed to him; ſo that he ſuffered more grief, then if the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of all men were put together. Chriſts Hell, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows on the Croſs were meritorious and fully ſatisfactory <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.</note> for our everlaſting puniſhment; and therefore in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were to exceed all other mens ſorrows, as being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to Gods juſtice. 2. By the dignity and worth of him that did ſuffer; Therefore the Scripture calls it the blood of God. The damned muſt bear the wrath of God to all Eternity, becauſe they can never ſatisfie the juſtice of God for ſin; therefore they muſt lye by it world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: but Chriſt hath made an infinit ſatisfaction in a finit time, by undergoing that fierce battel with the wrath of God, and getting the Victory in a few hours, which is equivalent to the Creatures bearing it, and grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it everlaſtingly. This length, or ſhortneſs of durance, is but a circumſtance not of any neceſſary conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this caſe. Suppoſe a man indebted a 100 <hi>l.</hi> and likely to lye in Priſon till he ſhall pay it, yet utterly unable; if another man comes, and lays down the money on two hours warning, is not this as well, or better done; that which may be done to as good or better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66517:88"/> in a ſhort time, what need is there to draw it out at length? The juſtice of the Law did not require that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sinner, or his Surety ſhould ſuffer the Eternity of Hells torments, but only their extremity; it doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly counterpoiſe the eternity of the puniſhment, that the perſon which ſuffered was the eternal God. Beſides, it was impoſſible that he ſhould be detained under the ſorrows of death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. And if he had been ſo detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Then he had not ſpoiled principalities and powers, nor triumphed over them,</hi> Col. 2. 15. but had been overcome, and ſo had not attained his end. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: The pains of Hell which Chriſt ſuffered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though they were not infinit in time, yet were they of an infinite price and value, for the dignity of the perſon that ſuffered them. Chriſts temporal enduring of Helliſh ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, was as effectual and meritorious, as if they had been perpetual; the dignity of Chriſts perſon did bear him out in that which was not meet for him to ſuffer, nor fit in reſpect of our Redemption; for if he ſhould have ſuffered Eternally, our Redemption could never have been accompliſhed; but for him to ſuffer in ſoul, as he did in body, was neither derogatory to his perſon, nor prejudicial to his work: Infinitly in time Chriſt was not to ſuffer, as one well obſerves, Chriſt dyed <hi>ſecundum tempus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ambroſe <hi>in</hi> 5. ad <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> in time, or according to time; <hi>Tempora in mundo ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. Times are in the world where the Sun riſeth and ſetteth; unto this time he dyed; but where there is no time, there he was found, not only living, but conquering. Chriſt, God-Man, ſuffered puniſhment in meaſure infinit, and therefore there is no ground why he ſhould endure it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; and indeed it was impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24.</note> holden of Death, becauſe he was both the Lord of life, and the Lords holy One, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 27. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: If the meaſure of a mans puniſhment were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the duration needs not be infinit; ſinful mans mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of puniſhment is finit, and therefore the duration of his puniſhment muſt be infinit, becauſe the puniſhment muſt be anſwerable to the infinit evil of ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66517:88"/> an infinit God. O Sirs, continual impriſonment in Hell, ariſes from mans not being able to pay the price; for could he pay the debt in one year, he needs not lye two years in Priſon. Now the debt is the firſt and ſecond death, and becauſe ſinful man cannot pay it in any time, he muſt endure it eternally; but now Chriſt has laid down ready pay upon the nail, to the full for all his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Ones; and therefore it is not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uired of him that he ſhould ſuffer for ever neither can it ſtand with the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or juſtice of God to hold him under the ſecond death, he having paid the debt to the utmoſt Farthing. Now that he hath fully paid the debt himſelf, witneſſeth <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. ſaying, when he had received the Vinegar, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> ſo verſ. 28. After this, Jeſus knowing that all things were accompliſhed. Though there are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations given of this place by <hi>Auguſtine, Chryſoſtom, Janſenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and others; yet doubtleſs, this alone will hold water, <hi>viz.</hi> That the heavy wrath of the Lord which did purſue Chriſt, and the ſecond death which filled him with grievous terrors, is now over and paſt, and mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption finiſhed; he ſpeaketh here of that which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be, and in the yielding up his Ghoſt was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee that Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the very torments of Hell, though not after a Helliſh manner; and you ſee alſo that Chriſt did not locally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into Hell: Shall we make a few inferences from hence.</p>
            <p>Firſt then: O! how ſhould theſe ſad ſufferings of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt for us, endear Chriſt to us. O! what precious thoughts ſhould we have of him; O! how ſhould we <note place="margin">

I have read of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he had a Shirt made of a <hi>Salamanders</hi> skin, ſo that if he did walk through the fire in it, it would keep him from burning.

            <p>Secondly: If Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the very torments of Hell, though not after a Helliſh manner, then let me infer, that certainly there is a Hell, a place of torment provided and prepared for all wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons. <hi>Danaeus</hi> reckons up no leſs than nineteen ſeveral ſorts of Hereticks that denyed it; and are there not many erronious and deluded perſons that ſtoutly, and daily aſſert that there is no Hell but what men feel in

Heaven is a place where all is joyful; and Hell is a place where all is doleful; in Heaven there is nothing but happineſs; and in Hell there is nothing but heavineſs, nothing but endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs torments. Did men believe this, how could they go ſo merrily on in the way to Hell? <hi>Cato</hi> once ſaid to <hi>Caeſar, (credo quae deniferis dicuntur falſa eſſe exiſtimas.)</hi> I believe that thou thinkeſt all that is ſaid of Hell to be falſe and fabulous. So I may ſay to many in this day, Surely you think that all that is ſpoken, and written of Hell, is but a ſtory. Don't you look upon the people of God to be of all men the moſt miſerable, and your ſelves of all men the moſt happy.

Man before his Fall was the beſt of Creatures, but ſince his Fall, he is become the worſt of Creatures: He that was once the Image of God, the glory of Paradiſe, the worlds Lord, and the Lords darling, is now become an abomination to God, a burden to Heaven, a Plague to the World, and a ſlave to Satan. When Man firſt came out of Gods Mint, he did ſhine moſt gloriouſly, as being beſpangled with Holineſs, and clad with the royal Robe of Righteouſneſs; his Underſtanding was filled with knowledge; his Will with uprightneſs; his Affections with holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet being a mutable Creature, and ſubject to temptations, Satan quickly ſtript him of his happineſs, and cheated, and couſened him of his Imperial Crown (as we uſe to do Children) with an Apple. If God had created Angels and men immutable, he had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them Gods, and not Creatures; but being made mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, we know they did fall from their primitive purity and glory; and we know that out of the whole Hoſt of Angels, he kept ſome from falling; and when all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was fallen, he Redeemed ſome by his Son.

            <p>In this Scripture our Lord Jeſus doth allude to the cuſtom of puniſhing Offenders, uſed among the Jews; now there were three degrees of puniſhments that were uſed among the Jews. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt: In every Town where there were a hundred and twenty Inhabitants, there was a little Councel of three, which judged ſmaller matters, for which, whipping, or ſome pecuniary mulct was impoſed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; There was a Councel conſiſting of three and twenty; ſeven of theſe were Judges, fourteen Aſſeſſors, <note place="margin">Joſephus.</note> who were moſtly of the Levites; and to theſe were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſupernumeraries which made the twenty-three, which the Hebrews generally ſay, was the number that made up this ſecond Councel. Now this Councel ſate in the Gates of the City, and did judge of civil matters, having alſo power of life and death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: There was the great Synedrion, or High-Court <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Judicatory, which conſiſted of ſeventy and two, ſix choſen of every Tribe. Now this Councel ſate in the Court of the Temple, and had all matters of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought before them, as Hereſie, Idolatry, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <note place="margin">Beza.</note> Somtimes they convented before them the High-Prieſt, and ſomtimes falſe Prophets, yea, ſomtimes a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66517:94"/> whole Tribe, as my Reverend Author thinks. Now look as there is a gradation of ſin, ſo there is a gradation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment pointed at in this Scripture; for the opening of which, conſider you have here three degrees of ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or of inward heart-murder. And</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is Raſh anger: Now this brings a man in danger of the Judgment. By the judgment, he means not the judgment of the three, who judged of mony-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but by judgment, he means the Counſel of the three and twenty men: Now they are called the Judgment, becauſe they judged of Murthers, and inflicted death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he that ſhall raſhly, vainly, cauſeleſly, unſeaſonably be angry with his Brother, he ſhall be liable to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are to be inflicted by the Judges. Look what puniſhments they in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> inflicted upon actual and apparent Murderers, the ſame were they liable to, and did deſerve at the hands of God, who were guilty of this ſecret kind of Murther, <hi>viz. Raſh Anger.</hi> From the different degrees of puniſhments among the Jews, Chriſt would ſhew the degrees of puniſhment in another world, according to the greatneſs of mens ſins; as if he ſhould ſay, Look as among you Jews, there are different offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome are judged in your little Counſel of three, and others are judged in your Counſel of three and twenty, and others in your great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> So in the high Court of Heaven, ſome ſins, as Raſh Anger, are leſs puniſhed; and others are more ſorely puniſhed, as when your Raſh Anger ſhall break forth into railings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe words, <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of Judgment.</hi> You may ſee that Chriſt gives as much to Raſh Anger, as the Jews did to Murther; as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>You</hi> Phariſees <hi>exceed all meaſure and bounds in your anger, and with a malicious heart, you rail upon the moſt innocent perſons, upon me and my Diſciples; but I would have you take heed of Raſh Anger, for you ſhall have greater torments in Hell for your Raſh anger, than thoſe that Murderers ſuffer by your Counſel of three and twenty:</hi> But theſe words, <hi>he ſhall be in danger of Judgment,</hi> do
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66517:94"/> contain the reward and puniſhment of unlawful anger; as if our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Raſh Anger ſhall not eſcape juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but ſhall be arraigned and ſummoned before Gods Tribunal at the dreadful day of Judgment, when the angry man ſhall not be able to anſwer one word of a thouſand.</hi>

               <hi>Gehenna; Gehenna</hi> comes from the Hebrew word <hi>Gettin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> that is the Valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> lying near the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in which Valley, in former times the Itolatrous <note place="margin">

And hence the Scripture often makes uſe of that word, to ſignifie the place of eternal puniſhment, where the damned muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide under the wrath of God for ever. There were four kinds of puniſhments exerciſed among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Firſt: Stranglings. 2. The Sword. 3. Stoning. 4. The Fire. Now this laſt, they always judged the worſt, as <hi>Beza</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms upon this very place. In theſe words, <hi>Shall be in danger of Hell-fire,</hi> Chriſt alludes to the great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and the higheſt degree of puniſhment that was inflicted by them, namely, to be burned in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> which by a known Metaphor is transferred to Hell it ſelf, and the inexpreſſible torments thereof: For, as thoſe poor wretches being incloſed in a brazen Idol-heat with fire, were miſerably tormented in this Valley of <hi>Hinnom.</hi> So the wicked being caſt into Hell, the Priſon of the damn'd ſhall be eternally tormented in unquenchable fire. This Valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> by reaſon of the pollution of it with ſlaughter, blood, and ſtencth of Carkaſſes, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo execrable, that Hell it ſelf did afterwards inherit the ſame Name, and was called <hi>Gehenna</hi> of this very place. And that 1. In reſpect of the hollowneſs and depth thereof, being a low and deep Valley. 2. This Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> was a place of miſery in regard of thoſe many ſlaughters that were committed in it through their barbarous Idolatry. So Hell is a place of miſery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity, wherein there is nothing but ſorrow. 3. Thirdly: By the bitter and lamentable crys of poor Infants in this Valley, is ſhadowed out the crys and lamentable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned in Hell. 4. In this Valley of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom</hi> was another fire which was kept continually burning for the conſuming of dead Carkaſſes, and filth, and the garbidge that came out of the City. Now our Saviour,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66517:95"/> by the fire of <hi>Gehenna,</hi> in this <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. hath reference principally to this fire, ſignifying hereby, the perpetuity and everlaſtingneſs of Helliſh pains: To this laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> viz. <hi>Burning:</hi> Doth Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate that kind of Murder, which is by open reviling of a Brother, that he might notifie the heynouſneſs of this ſin; marke in this Scripture, Judgment, Councel, and Hell fire do but ſignifie three degrees of the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>See alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29, 30. <hi>And if thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee;</hi> for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy Members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into Hell: <hi>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee;</hi> for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy Members ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire. <hi>Julian</hi> taking theſe commands literally, mockt at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as fooliſh, cruel, and vain, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men to maim their members. He mockt at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe no man did it; and he mockt at Chriſt becauſe no man obeyed him; but this Apoſtate, might have ſeen from the ſcope, that theſe words were not to be taken literally, but figuratively.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66517:97"/> to the men of the Old World, who are now in Hell: In <hi>Noahs</hi> time they were on Earth, but in <hi>Peters</hi> time they were in Hell. Mark, Chriſt did not Preach by his Spirit, in his Miniſtry, or any other way to Spirits, who were in Priſon (or in Hell) while he Preached to them. There are no Sermons in Hell, nor any Salvation there. The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs of God is abundantly declared on Earth, but it ſhall never be declared in Hell. Look as there is nothing felt in Hell but deſtruction, ſo there is nothing found in Hell of the offers of Salvation. One offer of Chriſt in Hell, would turn Hell into a Heaven. One of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents hath reported the opinion of ſome in his time, who thought, that thou there be deſtruction in Hell, yet not eternal deſtruction, but that Sinners ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome a leſſer, others, a longer time, and that at laſt, all ſhall be freed; <hi>And yet</hi> (ſaith he) Origen <hi>was more merciful in this point than theſe men, for he held that the Devil himſelf ſhould be ſaved at laſt.</hi> Of this opinion <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay no more in this place, then this one thing which he there ſaid. Theſe men will be found to erre by ſo much the more fouly, and againſt the right words of God ſo much the more perverſly, by how much they ſeem to themſelves to judge more mercifully; for indeed the juſtice of God in puniſhing of Sinners, is as much above <note place="margin">

But</p>
            <p>The third Argument to prove that there is a Hell, is this. The beams of natural light in ſome of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have made ſuch impreſſions on the heart of natural
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66517:97"/> Conſcience, that ſeveral of them have had confuſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Hell, as well as of a Judgment to come. Though the poor blind Heathens were ignorant of Chriſt and the Goſpel, and the great work of Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet by the light of Nature, and reaſonings from thence, they did attain to the underſtanding of a Deity, who was both juſt and good; as alſo, that the ſoul was immortal, and that both rewards and puniſhments were prepared for the ſouls of men after this life, according as they were found either vertuous or vicious.

Look as theſe poor Heathens did feign ſuch a place as the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zean Fields, where the Vertuous ſhould ſpend an Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in pleaſures; ſo alſo they did feign a place called <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> or Hell, where the Vicious ſhould be Eternally tormented. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and after him, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Poets and Phyloſophers, and all ſorts of men, ſpeaking of a future retribution, have ſaid, that many are puniſht in Hell. <hi>Plato</hi> is very plain, that whoever are not expiated, but prophane, ſhall go into Hell to be tormented for their wickedneſſes, with the greateſt, moſt bitter and terrible puniſhments for ever in that Priſon in Hell.

            <p>Suppoſe, ſay others, that the torments of Hell were to end, after a little Bird ſhould have emptyed the Sea, and only carry out her bill full once in a thouſand years. Suppoſe, ſay others, that the whole world, from the loweſt Earth, to the higheſt Heavens, were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grains of Sand, and once in a thouſand years an Angel ſhould fetch away one grain, and ſo continue till the whole heap were ſpent.

            <p>You know that the extremity and eternity of Helliſh torments, is ſet forth by the Worm that never dyes; and it is obſervable, that Chriſt, at the cloſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, makes a threefold repetition of this Worm, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44. <hi>where their Worm dyeth not,</hi> and again, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>where their Worm dyeth not, and their fire goeth not out.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe puniſhments are beyond all conception, and expreſſion, which our Lord Jeſus doth ſo often inculcate within ſo ſmall a pace.</p>
            <p>Now if there be ſuch a diverſity, extremity, and eternity of Helliſh pains and torments which the great God will certainly inflict upon the bodys and ſouls of all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons, after the day of Judgment, then there muſt certainly be ſome Hell, ſome place of torment, wherein the wrath of God ſhall be executed upon wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.

The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors have a pretty Parable to this purpoſe. A man planted an Orchard, and going from home, was careful to leave ſuch Watch-men, as both might keep it from Strangers, and not deceive him themſelves; therefore he appointed one blind, but ſtrong of his Limbs, and the other ſeeing, but a Cripple; theſe two in their Maſters abſence conſpired together, and the Blind took the Lame on his Shoulders, and ſo gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fruit; their Maſter returning, and finding out this ſubtlety, puniſhed them both together. So ſhall it be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66517:104"/> with thoſe two ſinful Yoke-fellows, the ſoul and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in the great day, <hi>They have ſinned together, and they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall ſuffer at laſt together.</hi> But now in this world, the greateſt number of Tranſgreſſors do commonly eſcape all ſorts of puniſhments, and therefore we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is another World wherein the Righteous God will revenge upon the bodies and ſouls of Sinners the high diſhonours that have been done to his Name by them. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly: In all things natural, and ſupernatural, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> there is an oppoſition and contrariety. There is good, and there is evil; there is light and darkneſs, joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Now as there are two ſeveral ways, ſo there are two diſtinct ends. Heaven, a place of admirable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible happineſs, whether the good Angels convoy the ſouls of the Saints, who have by a holy converſation, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22.</note> glorified God, and adorned their Profeſſion. And Hell a place of horror and confuſion, whither the evil Angels do hurry the ſouls of wicked incorrigible, and impenitent wretches, when they are once ſeparated from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The Rich man alſo dyed, and was buryed; and in <note place="margin">ver. 22, 23.</note> Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments; and theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous into life Eternal. In theſe words we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the different Eſtate of the Wicked and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 46.</note> after Judgment: <hi>They ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but theſe into life eternal.</hi> After the ſentence is paſt, the Wicked go into everlaſting puniſhment, and the Righteous into life eternal. Everlaſting puniſhment, the end thereof is not known, its duration is undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind. Hell is a bottomleſs pit, and therefore ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be fathomed. It is an unquenchable fire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſmoak of their torments doth aſcend for ever and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11.</note> ever. Hell is a Priſon, from whence is no freedom, becauſe there is no Ranſom to be paid; no price will be accepted for one in that Eſtate. And as there is no end of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, into which the wicked muſt enter, ſo there is no end of the joys of Heaven, into which the Saints
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66517:105"/> muſt enter. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Here is as much ſaid as can be ſaid for quality, there is in Heaven joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; for quantity, a fulneſs, a torrent; for conſtancy, it is at Gods right hand; and for perpetuity it is for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. The joys of Heaven are without meaſure, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or end. Thus you ſee that there are two diſtinct ends, two diſtinct places, to which the wicked and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous go. And indeed, if this were not ſo, then <hi>Nero</hi> would be as good a man as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> as happy a man as <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> as bleſſed a man as <hi>Abel.</hi> Then as Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſay, <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of</hi>

            <p>8thly, and laſtly: You know that all the Princes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> World, for their greater Grandure and State, as they have their Royal Palaces for themſelves, their Nobles and Attendants, ſo they have their Goals, Priſons, and dark Dungeons for Rogues and Robbers, for Malefactors and Traytors.

And ſhall not the ſame great King have his Hell, his Priſon, his Dungeon, to ſecure and puniſh impenitent Sinners in? ſurely yes, and doubtleſs, the leaſt glimpſe of this Hell, of this place of torment, would ſtrike the proudeſt, and the ſtouteſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners dead with horror.

               <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, relates, how it was a by-word of the Lord <hi>Cordes,</hi> (who was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Popiſh, Atheiſtical French Lord) that he could be content to lye ſeven years in Hell, ſo he might win <hi>Callice</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but had this Popiſh Lord lyen but ſeven minutes under unſupportable torments, he would quickly have repented of his mad bargain. It was good Counſel that one of the Ancients gave, <hi>Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus in infernum viventes, ne deſcendamus morientes,</hi> Let us go into Hell while we are alive, by a ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66517:106"/> and holy conſideration, that we may not go into it <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> when we be dead by real miſeries. God can kill, and more than that, He can caſt into Hell; here is both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal deſtruction, both Rods and Scorpians. He can kill the body, and then damn both body &amp; ſoul, and caſt them into Hell; and therefore it becomes every one to ſet up God as the great object of their fear. Yea, <hi>I</hi> ſay unto you, fear him; yea, <hi>I</hi> ſay unto you fear him. This redoubling of the ſpeech adds a greater enforcement to the admonition: 'Tis like the laſt ſtroke of the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that rivets and drives up all to the head. Thus <hi>David</hi> uſes this ingemination. <hi>Thou, even Thou art to be</hi>

Our Saviour ſaith not, <hi>Yea, I ſay unto you, fear not them;</hi> but he places the reduplication upon the affirmative precept. <hi>I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> O Sirs, temporal judgments are but the ſmoak of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but in Hell there are the flames of his Anger, that fire burns fiercely, and there is no quenching of it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me (ſaith the Father) thou breakeſt bonds and impriſonments, O Emperour, but God's threatnings are much more terrible; He threatens Hell-torments and everlaſting damnation; and certainly, where there is the greateſt danger, there 'tis fit that there ſhould be the greateſt dread.

                  </gap> Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 33.</note> Oh Sirs, that you would ſeriouſly and frequently dwell upon theſe ſhort hints.</p>
            <p>1. Wrath to come is the greateſt Wrath, 'tis the greateſt Evil that can befal a Soul. <hi>Who knows the power of thy Wrath,</hi> Pſal. 19. 11. Wrath to come, is ſuch Wrath as no man can either avoyd, or abide, and yet ſuch is moſt mens ſtupidity, that they will not believe it till they feel it. As God is a great God, ſo his Wrath is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66517:107"/> a great Wrath. <hi>I</hi> may allude to that which <hi>Zebah</hi> and <note place="margin">Nahum. 1. 16. Judg. 8. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Zalmunua</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gideon, As the man is, ſo is his ſtrength.</hi> So may <hi>I</hi> ſay, as the Lord is, ſo is his Wrath. The wrath of an earthly King, is compared to the roaring of <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 12.</note> a Lyon. <hi>Heb.</hi> of a young Lyon, which (being in his prime) roars moſt terribly; he roars with ſuch a force, that he amazes the Creatures whom he hunts ſo, as that they have no power to fly from him. Now if the Wrath of a King be ſo terrible, Oh how dreadful muſt the Wrath of the King of Kings then be. The greater the <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 14.</note> evil is, the more cauſe we have to flee from it, Now, Wrath to come, is the greateſt evil, and therefore the more it concerns us to flee from it. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: Wrath to come, is Treaſured up Wrath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sinners are ſtill a Treaſuring up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath; in Treaſuring there is, 1. Laying in. <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> 2. Lying hid. 3. Bringing out again as there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Whilſt wicked men are following their own Luſts, they think that they are ſtill adding to their own happineſs; but alas, they do but add Wrath to Wrath, they do but heap up Judgment upon Judgment, puniſhment upon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Look as men are daily adding to their Treaſure more &amp; more. So impenitent Sinners are daily encreaſing the Treaſures of wrath againſt their own ſouls. Now who would not flee from Treaſures of Wrath. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Wrath to come, is pure Wrath, <hi>'Tis Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

But</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly: As Wrath to come is pure wrath, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſo Wrath to come is everlaſting Wrath; <hi>Rev. 14. 11.

               <hi>Gregory) ſhall ſuffer an end without end, a death without death, a decay without decay; for their death ever liveth, their end ever beginneth, their decay never ceaſeth, they are ever healed to be new wounded, and always repaired to be new devoured; they are ever dying, and never dead, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally broyling, and never burnt up; ever roaring in the pangs of death, and never rid of thoſe pangs; for they ſhall have puniſhment without pitty, miſery without mercy, ſorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour, crying without comfort, miſchief without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and torment without eaſe, where the Worm dyeth not, and the Fire is never quenched.</hi> The Torments of the Damned ſhall continue as many Worlds, as there be Stars in the Firmament, as there be grains of Sand on the Sea-ſhore, and as there be drops of Water found in the Sea; and when theſe Worlds are ended, the pains and torments of Hell ſhall not ceaſe, but begin, a freſh; and thus this Wheel ſhall turn round without end.</p>

But for a cloſe you will ſay, <hi>ubi ſit; where is hell,</hi> where
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66517:111"/> is this place of torment, where is that very place that is ſo frequently called Hell in the Scripture? That there is a Hell, you have ſufficiently proved; but pray, where is it, where is it? Now, to this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it becomes all ſober, ſerious Chriſtians, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reſt ſatisfied and contented with thoſe Scriptural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that do undeniably prove that there is a Hell, a place appointed, where the wicked, the damned ſhall be tormented for ever and ever, though they do not know, nor for the preſent, cannot underſtand where this Hell is. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, curioſity is one of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <note place="margin">2. Curious enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have always layen under the laſh of Chriſt, as you may ſee by comparing theſe Scriptues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Joh. 21. 22. Act. 1. 6, 7. Luk. 13. 22, 24.</hi>
               </note> Engines, that the Devil uſes to undo ſouls withal. When Satan obſerves, that men do in good earneſt, ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the obtaining of knowledg, then he ſtrives to turn them to vain enquiries, and curious ſpeculations; that ſo, if they will be knowing, he may keep them buſied about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable curioſities. The way to make us mere fools, is to affect to know more than God would have us: <hi>Adam</hi>'s tree of knowledg made him and his poſterity fools: Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity wa the bait, whereby the Devil caught our firſt <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5, 6.</note> parents, and undid us all: Curioſity is the ſpiritual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the ſoul: Curioſity is ſpiritual drunkenneſs; ſo <note place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. 77.</note> that, look as the Drunkard, be the cup never ſo deep, he is not ſatisfied, unleſs he ſee the bottom of i; ſo the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearcher into the depths of God, he is unſatisfied till he comes to the bottom of them, and by this means, they come to be mere fools, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Adam</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> had a mind to know as much of God, as God himſelf; and by this means he came to know nothing. Curioſity is that Green ſickneſs of the ſoul, whereby it longs for novelties, and loaths ſound and wholeſome truths: 'tis <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith divers queſtions may be made about a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fly, which no Philoſopher is ever able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: how much rather about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hell, or the work of Grace.</note> the Epidemical diſtemper of this Age: Ah, how many are there, who ſpend their precious time in nice and curious queſtions. As, what did Chriſt diſpute of among the Doctors? where did Paradiſe ſtand? in what part of the world is Local Hell? what fruit was it that <hi>Adam</hi> eat, and ruined us all? what became of <hi>Moſes</hi> his body? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66517:111"/> orders and degrees of elect Angels are there? &amp;c. O! that we could learn contentedly to be ignorant, where God would not have us knowing, and let's nor account it any diſparagement to acknowledge ſome depths in Gods Counſels, Purpoſes, Decrees and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> which our ſhallow reaſon cannot fathom. 'Tis ſad when men will be wiſe above what is written, and <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3. 1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> love to pry into Gods ſecrets, and ſcan the myſteries of Religion by carnal reaſon: God often plagues ſuch pride and curioſity, by leaving that ſort of men to ſtrange and fearful falls. When a curious Inquiſitor ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Auſtin</hi> what God did before he created the world, <hi>Auſtin</hi> told him he was making Hell for ſuch buſie Queſtioniſts, for ſuch cuious inquirers into Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: ſuch handſome jerks are the beſt anſwers to men <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> of curious minds. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, I concerns us but little, to know whether Hell be in the Air, or in the concave of the <note place="margin">3. Let us not be in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quiſitive where Hell is, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let our care be to eſcape it, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtem.</hi>

But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, That it has been the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> opinion of the Fathers, that Hell is in the bowels of the <note place="margin">Infernum eſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſubterraneus. Teriu. lib. 3. de Anim.</note> earth; yea Chriſt and the bleſſed Scriptures, which are the higheſt authority, do ſtrongly ſeem to favour this opinion, by ſpeaking of a Deſcent unto Hell, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto Heaven; and therefore we may as well doubt whether Heaven be above us, as doubt of Hell being beneath us: Among other Scriptures ponder upon theſe, <hi>Pſal 140. 10. Let them be caſt into the deep pits, that they riſe not up again. Bring them down into the pit of deſtruction. Prov. 9. 18. Her Gueſts are in the depths of Hell. Prov. 15. 24. The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath. Sheol is</hi> ſometimes taken for a pit, ſometimes for the Grave, and ſometimes, and that ſignificantly too for Hell, all down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. One ſaith, that <hi>Sheol</hi> generally ſignifies all <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mercerus</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.</note> places under the earth; whence ſome conclude, that Hell is in the heart of the earth, or under the earth; without doubt it is below, becauſe it is every where op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Heaven wich is above: it is therefore called <hi>Abyſſus,</hi> a deep pit, a vaſt gulf; ſuch a pit as by reaſon of the depth thereof may be ſaid to have no bottom.

            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, If Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the very torments of Hell, though not after a helliſh manner; then let me infer, that certainly the Papiſts are greatly out, they are greatly miſtaken, and do greatly err; who boldly and confidently aſſert, that Chriſts Soul in ſubſtance went really and locally into Hell: <note place="margin">Bellar. de Chriſt.

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes a great deal of pains to make good this aſſertion, but this great Champion of the Romiſh Church may eaſily be confuted: Firſt, becauſe that <hi>limbus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> and Chriſts fetching the fathers from the skirts of Hell, (about which he makes ſo great a noiſe) is a meer fable, and not bottomed upon any ſolid grounds of Scripture. Secondly, becauſe upon Chriſts dying, and ſatisfying for our ſins, his ſoul went that very day into Paradiſe; as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning, was that very day caſt out of <note place="margin">

Thirdly, becauſe this deſcent of Chriſts Soul into Hell, was altogether needleſs, and to no end; what need was there of it, or to what end did he deſcend? not to ſuffer in Hell, for that was finiſhed on the Croſs; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, or reſcue the Fathers out of Hell; for the elect were never there, and Redemption from Hell was wrought by Chriſts death, as the Scriptures do clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; not to triumph there over the Devils, &amp;c. For Chriſt triumphed over them when he was on the Croſs: Chriſt in the day of his ſolemn inauguration into his Heavenly Kingdom, triumphed over Sin, Death, Devils,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66517:114"/> and Hell; when Chriſt was on the Croſs, he made the Devils a publick ſpectacle of ſcorn and deriſion, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> did <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Turk, whom he ſhut up in an Iron Cage, made like a Grate, in ſuch ſort, as tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I might make other inferences, but let theſe ſuffice at this time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> torments of Hell, though not after a helliſh manner; ſo Jeſus Chriſt was really, certainly made a curſe for us: Jeſus Chriſt did in his ſoul and body bear that curſe of the Law, which by reaſon of tranſgreſſion was due to us: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gala. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>being made a curſe for us: for it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> He ſaith not Chriſt was curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but a curſe, which is more; it ſhews that the curſe of all did lie upon him. The death on the tree, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed above all kinds of deaths, as the Serpent was <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note> accurſed above all the beaſts of the field. This Scripture <note place="margin">Not that all that are hanged ſhould be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears in that <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. Neither is hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ſelf, or by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil law, more execrable than any other death.</note> refers to <hi>Deut. 21. 33. His body ſhall not remain all night upon the tree; but thou ſhalt in any wiſe hury him that day: for he that is hanged, is accurſed of God.</hi> The holy and wiſe God appointed this kind of puniſhment, as being the moſt cruel and reproachful, for a type of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which his Son muſt ſuffer to deliver us from the curſe. Hanging on a tree was accounted the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the moſt diſhonourable, the moſt odious, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and accurſed of all kinds of death, both by the Iſraelites and other nations, becauſe the very manner of the death, did intimate that ſuch men as were thus exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, were ſuch execrable, baſe, vile and accurſed wretches; that they did defile the earth with treading on it, and would pollute the earth if they ſhould die up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and therefore were hang'd up in the air, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not fit to converſe amongſt men, or touch the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66517:114"/> of the ground any more. But what ſhould be the reaſon why the ceremonial Law affixed the curſe to this death, rather than any other death: I anſwer firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was reckoned the moſt ſhameful and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of all deaths, and was uſually therefore the puniſhment of thoſe, that had by ſome notorious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs provoked God to pour out his wrath upon the whole land, and ſo were hanged up to appeaſe his wrath; as you may ſee in the hanging of thoſe Princes, that were guilty of committing whoredome with the Daughters of <hi>Moab:</hi> And in the hanging of <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Num. 25. 4.</note> ſons in the days of <hi>David,</hi> when there was a Famine <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 6. 7. 8, 2.</note> in the land, becauſe of <hi>Saul</hi>'s perfidious oppreſſing of the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> And in <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s hanging of the five Kings of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> But ſecondly and mainly, it was <note place="margin">Joſh. 16. 26.</note> with reſpect to the Death Chriſt was to die: God would have his Son the Lord Jeſus to ſuffer this kind of death, that hence it might be the more evident, that in his death he bare the curſe due to our ſins, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. 13. Chriſt was certainly made that curſe which he redeemed us from, otherwiſe the Apoſtle does not reaſon either ſoundly or fairly, when he tells us we are redeemed from the curſe, becauſe Chriſt was made a curſe for us; he remitteth that curſe to us, which he received in himſelf. That Father hit the <note place="margin">Bela in 3. ad Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</note> mark, who ſaith, <hi>Chriſtus ſupplicium noſtrum ſine reatu ſuſcepit, ut ſolveret reatum, &amp; finiret ſupplicium: Chriſt hath taken our puniſhment without guilt, to looſe the guilt, and end the puniſhment.</hi> We were ſubject to the curſe, becauſe we had tranſgreſſed the Law, Chriſt was not ſubject becauſe he had fulfilled it: <hi>Eam ergo execratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Oecumenius in 3. ad Galat.</note> 
               <hi>ſuſcepit, cui obnoxius non erat, quum ſuſpenſus ſuit in ligno, ut execrationem ſolveret, quae adverſùs nos erat: He therefore took that curſe to the which he was not ſubject, when he hanged upon the tree, to looſe the curſe which was againſt us.</hi> Such a curſe or execration was Chriſt made for us, as was that from which he redeemed us; and that curſe from which he redeemed us, was no other
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66517:115"/> than the curſe of the Law, and that curſe of the Law included all the puniſhment, which ſinners were to bear, or ſuffer for tranſgreſſion of the Law, of which his hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Croſs, was a ſign and ſymbol; and this curſe was Chriſt made for us, (that is) he did bear and ſuffer it to redeem us from it: Chriſt was verily made a curſe for us, and did bear both in his body and ſoul that curſe, which by reaſon of the tranſgreſſion of the Law was due to us: And therefore I may well conclude this head with that ſaying of <hi>Hierome. Injuria Domini, noſtra</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hierom. in 3. ad Galat.</note> 
               <hi>Gloria: The Lords injury is our Glory.</hi> The more we aſcribe to Chriſts ſuffering, the leſs remaineth of ours; the more painfully that he ſuffered, the more fully are we redeemed; the greater his ſorrow was, the greater our ſolace; his diſſolution is our conſolation, his Croſs our Comfort; his annoy, our endleſs joy; his diſtreſs in ſoul, our releaſe, his calamity our comfort; his miſery our mercy, his adverſity our felicity, his Hell our Heaven. Chriſt is not only accurſed, but a curſe; and this expreſſion is uſed both for more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy; and uſefulneſs to note out the truth and realneſs of the thing; and alſo to ſhew the order and way he took, for bringing us back unto that bleſſedneſs, which we had loſt. The Law was our righteouſneſs, in our innocent condition, and ſo it was our bleſſedneſs; but <note place="margin">James 1. 24.</note> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> falling away from God by his firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, plunged himſelf into all unrighteouſneſs, and ſo inwrapped himſelf in the curſe: Now Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> that he may reſtore the loſt man into an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of bleſſedneſs, he becomes that for them, which the Law is unto them; namely a curſe: beginning where the Law ends, and ſo going backward to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> of the Law to the uttermoſt, he becomes firſt a curſe for them, and then their righteouſneſs, and ſo their bleſſedneſs. Now Chriſts becoming a curſe for us, ſtands in this, that whereas we are all accurſed by the ſentence of the Law, becauſe of ſin, he now comes in our room, and ſtands under the ſtroke of that curſe,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66517:115"/> which of right belongs to us; So that it lies not now any longer on the backs of poor ſinners, but on him for <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note> them, and in their ſtead, therefore he is called a Surety: The Surety ſtands in the room of a Debtor, Malefactor, or him that is any way obnoxious to the Law, ſuch is <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity. We are by the doom of the Law, evil do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, Tranſgreſſors, and upon that ſcore, we ſtand indebted to the Juſtice of God; and lie under the ſtroke of his wrath: Now the Lord Jeſus ſeeing us in this condition, he ſteps in, and ſtands between us and the blow; yea, he takes this wrath and curſe off from us unto himſelf, he ſtands not only, or meerly, after the manner of a Surety among men, in the caſe of debt; For here the Surety indeed enters bond with the principal, for the payment of the debt; but yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that the debtor ſhould not put him to it, but that he ſhould diſcharge the debt himſelf, he only ſtands as a good ſecurity. No, Chriſt Jeſus doth not expect that we ſhould pay the debt our ſelves, but he takes it wholly to himſelf: As a Surety for a Murtherer or Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or ſome other notorious Malefactor, that hath broken priſon, and is run away; he lies by it body for body, ſtate for ſtate, and undergoes whatſoever the Malefactor is chargeable withal for ſatisfying the Law: Even ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands Surety for us run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate Malefactors; making himſelf liable to all that curſe, which belongs to us, that he might both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Law fully, and bring us back again to God: As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the room of all mankind fallen; ſo Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtands in the room of all mankind, which is to be reſtored; he ſuſtains the perſon of all thoſe which do ſpiritually deſcend from him, and unto whom he bears the relation of a Head: <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22. 23.</note> Chriſt did actually undergo, and ſuffer the wrath of God, and the fearful effects thereof, in the puniſhments threatned in the Law. As he became a debtor, and was ſo accounted, even ſo he became payment thereof; he was made a ſacrifice for ſin, and bare to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66517:116"/> that ever Divine Juſtice did, or could require, even the uttermoſt extent of the curſe of the Law of God, he muſt thus undergo the curſe, becauſe he had taken upon him our ſin. The Juſtice of the moſt High God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled in the Law, looks upon the Lord Jeſus as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe he hath undertaken for us, and ſeiſeth upon him accordingly, pouring down on his head the whole curſe, and all thoſe dreadful puniſhments, which are threatened in it againſt ſin, for the curſe followeth ſin, as the ſhadow the body; whether it be ſin inherent, or ſin imputed; even as the bleſſing follows righteouſneſs, whether it be righteouſneſs inherent, or righteouſneſs imputed. But</p>

God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> To which of <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> the Saints, <hi>or Angels did God ſay at any time, thou art my Son,</hi> The Heir of all things, the illuſtrious brightneſs of my Glory, and lively character of my perſon. Thy Throne oh God is for ever and ever, and all the Angels of God ſhall worſhip thee: Certainly he who is Gods own, proper, natural, conſubſtantial, coeſſential, only begotten Son, he is God: where ever this Sonſhip is, theres the Deity or the Divine Eſſence. Now Chriſt is thus Gods ſon, therefore he is God: What the Father is, as to his nature, that the Son muſt alſo be; now the firſt perſon the Father of Chriſt is God; whereupon he too, who is the Son, muſt be God alſo. A Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways participates of his Fathers eſſence, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them evermore an Identity and oneneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if therefore Chriſt be Gods Son (as is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent throughout the Scripture he is) then he muſt needs have that very nature and eſſence which God the Father hath, inſomuch that if the ſecond perſon be not really a God, the firſt perſon is but equivocally a Father. Theſe Scriptures out of the Old and New Teſtament are ſo evident, and pregnant to prove the Godhead of Chriſt, that they need no illuſtration, yea, they ſpeak ſo fully for the Divinity of Chriſt, that all the Arians and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians in the world, do but in vain go about to elude them. But</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:66517:117"/>
            <p>Secondly, Let us ponder ſeriouſly upon theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>John 3. 13. And no man hath aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, which is in Heaven. v. 31. He that cometh from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, is above all: he that cometh from Heaven is above all. John 8. 23. Ye are from beneath, I am from above. John 16. 28. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: and again I leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi> Now from theſe bleſſed Scriptures we may thus argue; He who was in Heaven, before he was on the earth; and who was alſo in Heaven, whileſt he was on the earth, is certainly the eternal God; but all this doth Jeſus Chriſt ſtrongly aſſert concerning himſelf, (as is evident in the Scriptures laſt cited) therefore he is the eternal God bleſſed for ever. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts eternal Deity, Coequality, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Conſubſtantiality with the Father, may be demonſtrated from his Divine Names and Titles: As</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is one of the incommunicable names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of God, which ſignifies his eternal eſſence.</p>
            <p>The Jews obſerve that in Gods name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod. 15. 3. Gen.</hi> 2. 4. The Jews call it <hi>Nomen Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſabile:</hi> But this name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not unſpeakable, in regard of the name, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, ſet forth by it, as <hi>Zanchy</hi> noteth. This name was always thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, when the Prieſt bleſſed the people. <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 24, 25, 26.</note> Trinity is implied. <hi>Je</hi> ſignifies the Preſent tenſe, <hi>Ho</hi> the praeterperfect tenſe, <hi>Vah</hi> the future. The Jews alſo obſerve, that in his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> all the Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are <hi>literae quieſcentes,</hi> that denote reſt, implying that in God, and from God is all our reſt: Every gracious ſoul is like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, he can find no reſt nor ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but in God: God alone is the godly mans Ark of reſt and ſafety. <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the incommunicable name of God, and is never attributed to any but God: <hi>Pſal. 83. 19. Thou whoſe name alone is JEHOVAH. Jehovah</hi> is a name ſo full of Divine myſteries, that the Jews hold it unlawful to pronounce it. <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſignifies three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:66517:118"/>1. That God is an eternal independent being of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he gives being to all creatures. <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That he doth, and will give being to his promiſes. God tells <hi>Moſes, Exod. 6. 3. That he appeared unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, unto Iſaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of (El</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Shaddai) God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</hi> The name <hi>Jehovah</hi> was known to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but not <hi>myſterium nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, the myſtery of the name:</hi> This was reveiled to <hi>Moſes</hi> from God, and from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people: It is meant of the performances of his great promiſes made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> God did promiſe to give the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed for an inheritance, which promiſe was not performed to him, but to his ſeed after him; ſo that this is the meaning, <hi>God appeared to Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, El Shaddai, God Almighty,</hi> in protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, delivering and rewarding of them, but by his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he was not known to them; God did perform his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> but unto their ſeed and poſterity after them. This name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the proper and peculiar name of the one, only true God, a name as far ſignificant of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and being, as poſſibly we are enabled to underſtand; ſo that this is taken for granted on all hands, that he whoſe name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is the only true God, when ever that name is uſed properly, without a Trope or figure, it is uſed of God only.</p>
            <p>Now this glorious name <hi>Jehovah;</hi> that is ſo full of myſteries, is frequently aſcribed to Chriſt. <hi>Iſa</hi> 6. 1. He is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for there <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſaid to ſee <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah ſitting upon a Throne, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 12. 41. This is expreſly by the holy Evangeliſt applyed to Chriſt, of whom he ſaith, That <hi>Iſaiah ſaw his glory, and ſpake of him. Exod.</hi> 17. 1. The people are ſaid to tempt <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 9. Let us not tempt</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:66517:118"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Jehovah, Of old haſt thou laid the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>foundation of the earth, and the Heavens are the works of thy hands: they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure,</hi> &amp;c. And the Apoſtle clearly teſtifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. That theſe words are ſpoken of Chriſt. So <hi>Jehovah</hi> rained fire and brimſtone from <hi>Jehovah</hi> out of Heaven. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24. That is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son of God, that ſtayed with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi> 18. rained fire and brimſtone from <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> the Father, and Chriſt is called <hi>Jehovah Tſidkenu,</hi> the Lord our righteouſneſs, and in that <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 7. Chriſt is called the Fathers fellow. The Lord Chriſt is that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to whom every knee muſt bow, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. with <hi>Romans</hi> 14. 9, 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 9, 10, 11. I might further inſiſt upon this argument, and ſhew that the title of Lord ſo often given to Chriſt in the New Teſtament, doth anſwer to the Title of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Old Teſtament. And as ſome learned men conceive, the Apoſtles did purpoſely uſe the Title of Lord, that they might not offend the Jews, with frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the word <hi>Jehovah. Thou ſhalt fear Jehovah thy God: Deut. 6. 13. Deut.</hi> 10. 20. is rendred by the Apoſtle, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi> And ſo <hi>Deut. 6. 5. Thou ſhalt love Jehovah thy God,</hi> is rendred <hi>Matth. 22. 37. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus you ſee that in ſeveral precious Scriptures Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and therefore we may very ſafely and confidently conclude, that Jeſus Chriſt is very God. God bleſſed for ever. But</p>
            <p>The ſecond Name or Title which denotes the eſſence <note place="margin">2: The Hebrew <hi>Ehieh aſher Ehieh</hi> properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>I will be that I will be:</hi> The Septuagint renders it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>I am he that is,</hi> and in that <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5. God is called, he that is, and that was, and that will be.</note> of God is <hi>Ehieh, I am that I am,</hi> or I will be, what I I will be. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14. It hath the ſame root with <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> and ſignifies that God is an eternal, unchangeable
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66517:119"/> being: ſome make this name to be Gods extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary name. <hi>Damaſcene</hi> ſaith this name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all things in it, like a vaſt and infinite Ocean without bounds. This Glorious name of God, <hi>I AM THAT I AM,</hi> implyes theſe ſix things. 1. Gods incomprehenſibleneſs, as we uſe to ſay of any thing we would not have others prye into, it is what it is; ſo God ſaith here to <hi>Moſes, I AM WHAT I AM.</hi> 2. It implies Gods Immenſity, that his being is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limits; Angels and men have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but then they are bounded and limited within ſuch a compaſs, but God is an immenſe being, that cannot be included within any bounds. 3. It implyes that God is of himſelf, and hath not a being dependent upon any other: <hi>I am,</hi> that is, by and from, and of my ſelf. 4. It implyes Gods eternal, and unchangeable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf: It implyes God's everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>I am before any thing was, and ſhall for ever be:</hi> There never was, nor ſhall be time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God could not ſay of himſelf, <hi>I am.</hi> 5. It implyes, That there is no ſucceſſion of time with God. And 6. It implyes that he is a God, <note place="margin">Every creature is temporary and mutable, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ſay, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro qui ero, I will be that I will be.</hi>
               </note> that gives being to all things. In ſhort, the reaſon why God nameth himſelf, <hi>I AM THAT I Am,</hi> or will be that I will be, is becauſe he is the being of beings; ſubſiſting by himſelf, as if he ſhould ſay; I am my being, I am my eſſence; my exiſtence differeth not from my eſſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>I am that I am,</hi> and as I am, ſo will I be to all eternity, the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever.

            <p>Now this Glorious Name is given to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev. 1. 8. I am Alpha and Omega, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In this verſe you have a clear and pregnant proof of Chriſts Deity.</note>

The ſence is, I was before all creatures, and ſhall abide for ever, though all creatures ſhould periſh, or I am he, from whom all creatures had their beginning, and to whom they are referred, as their uttermoſt end.

The Almighty, this is another Epithete proper to God, which Chriſt alſo taketh to himſelf, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is the true, eternal and omnipotent God, in all things equal, and coeſſential with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt.

               <hi>and beſides me there is no God: I am God Almighty.</hi> But Chriſt doth challenge as due to himſelf, all theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes; therefore he is <hi>Jehovah</hi> that one, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and omnipotent God with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt; O the Statelineſs and Majeſty of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; what an excellent and ſtately perſon is he? there being not a property attributed to God, but is agreeable to Chriſt: Every word in this <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8.

            <p>The third name or Title, which denotes the Eſſence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of God is <hi>Elohim,</hi> which ſignifies the perſons in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. 'Tis a name of the plural number expreſſing the Trinity of perſons in the unity of Eſſence: and therefore it is obſerved by the learned, that the Holy Ghoſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſtory of the Creation with this plural name of God, joyned with a Verb of the ſingular number; as <hi>Elohim Bara, Dii oreavit,</hi> the mighty Gods, or all the <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1, 2.</note> three perſons in the Godhead created.

They now being acquainted with this language, and the Apoſtle writing to them, he ſaith that God by Chriſt made the worlds, thoſe worlds which they were wont to ſpeak ſo frequently of. And whereas one ſcruple might ariſe from that expreſſion in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, God created all things [By] Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and this to the <hi>Hebrews, By whom he made the worlds:</hi> As if Chriſt were only an inſtrument in the Creation, and not the principal efficient: Therefore another place in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clear it, which ſpeaketh of Chriſt as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

The preſervation and ſuſtentation of all things, <hi>Coloſ. 1. 17. by him all things conſiſt:</hi> They would ſoon fall aſunder had not Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to uphold the ſhattered condition thereof, by the word of his power: All creatures that are made are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him in being, life, and motion; <hi>Heb. 1. 3. He upholdeth all things by the word of his power.</hi> Both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of being, excellencies and operations, ſin had hurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confuſion over the world; which would have fallen about <hi>Adam</hi>'s ears, had not Chriſt undertaken the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered condition thereof, to uphold it. He keeps the world together (ſaith one) as the hoops do the barrel: Chriſt bears up all things, continuing to the ſeveral crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures their being, ordering and governing them, and this he doth by the word of his power; by this word he made the world; <hi>[He ſpake, and it was done:]</hi> And by this word he governeth the world, by his own mighty word, the word of his power: both theſe are divine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and being aſcribed unto Chriſt, evidence him to be no leſs than God. Now from what has been ſaid, we may thus argue; He to whom thoſe actions are aſcribed, which are proper to the moſt high God, he is the moſt high God; but ſuch actions or works are aſcribed to Chriſt <hi>ergo,</hi> he is the moſt high God. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Chriſt's eternal Deity may be demonſtrated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> from that divine honour and worſhip that is due to him, and by Angels and Saints given unto him.

Divine worſhip is due to the ſecond perſon of this coeſſential Trinity, to Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and God. There is but one immediate, formal, proper, adequate and fundamental reaſon of divine worſhip or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorability (as the ſchools ſpeak) and that is the ſoveraign, ſupreme, ſingular, majeſty, independent and infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the eternal Godhead; for by divine worſhip we do acknowledge and declare the infinite majeſty, truth, wiſdom, goodneſs and glory of our bleſſed God: we do not eſteem any thing worthy of divine honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which hath but a finite and created glory; becauſe divine honour is proper and peculiar to the only true God, who will not give his glory to any other who is not God. God alone is the adequate object of divine faith, hope, love, and worſhip, becauſe theſe graces are all exerciſed, and this worſhip performed in acknowledgment of his infinite perfection. and independent excellency; and therefore no ſuch worſhip can be due to any creature, or thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God. There is not one kind of divine honour due to the father, and another to the ſon, nor one degree of honour due to the father, and another to the ſon; for there can be no degrees imaginable in one and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, which is ſingle becauſe infinite, and what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite doth excel and tranſcend all degrees and bounds. And if there be no degrees in the ground and adequate reaſon of divine worſhip, there can be no reaſon or ground of a difference of degrees in the worſhip it ſelf: The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſon are one; one in power, excellency, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66517:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> nature of God. Thus you ſee the divine nature, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, is an undeniable ground of this coequal honour, and therefore the worſhip due to Chriſt as God, the ſame God with his father, is the very ſame worſhip, both for kind and degree, which is due to the father. But for the further and clearer opening of this, conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that all inward worſhip is due to Chriſt; as, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> on him, Faith is a worſhip which belongs only to God, enjoyned in the firſt Commandement; and againſt truſting in man is there a curſe denounced. But Chriſt <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 5. v.</note> commands us to believe in him; <hi>John 14, 1. Ye believe in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>God, believe alſo in me,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> verſ. 36. <hi>He that believeth in the ſon, hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the ſon, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> John 6. 47. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> The ſame reſpect that Chriſtians give unto God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they muſt alſo give unto the ſon, believing on him, which is an honour due only to God; other creatures, men and Angels, may be believed, but not believed on, reſted on; this were to make them Gods, this were no leſs than Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, loving of Jeſus Chriſt with all the heart, commanded above the love, nay even to the hatred of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, wife, children, yea and our own lives; <hi>Luk</hi> 14. 26. He who is not diſpoſed (where theſe loves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible) to hate father, and all other relations for the love of Chriſt, can be none of his: I ought dearly and tenderly to love father and mother (the Law of God and nature requiring it of me;) but to prefer dear Jeſus, <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, all outward worſhip is due to Chriſt; as, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

Though the wiſe men of the Eaſt, who ſaw <hi>Herod</hi> in all his Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory, worſhipped not him, yet they fell down before Chriſt: No doubt, but that by divine inſtinct they knew the divinity of Chriſt, hence they worſhipped him, not only with civil worſhip, as one born King of the Jews, but with divine worſhip; which was, it's like, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſture of reverence, and kneeling, and falling down, for ſo the Greek words ſignifie. Is it probable that they would worſhip a young babe, that by reaſon of his infancy underſtands nothing, except they did believe ſome divine thing to be in him? and therefore not the <note place="margin">Chryſoſtom.</note> childhood, but the divinity in the child was worſhipped by them: certainly if Chriſt had been no more than a natural child, they would never have undertaken ſo long, ſo tedious, and ſo perillous a journey to have found him out: principally conſidering (as ſome conceive) they themſelves were little inferiour to the Kings of the Jews. It is uncertain what theſe wiſe men (who were Gentiles) knew particularly concerning the myſtery of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> but certainly they knew that he was ſomething more than a man, by the internal Revelation of the ſpirit of God; who by faith, taught them to believe, that he was a King though in a cottage; and a God, though in a cradle: and therefore as unto a God, they fell down and worſhipped him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, when Jeſus Chriſt was declared to the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God did command even the moſt glorious Angels to wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip him, as his natural any coeſſential ſon, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten from the days of Eternity, in the unity of the God-head; for when he brought in his firſt-begotten, and only-begotten ſon into the world, he ſaid, <hi>And let all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> Heb. 6. The glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who refuſe divine honour to be given to themſelves; <hi>ſee thou do it not,</hi> ſaith the Angel to <hi>John,</hi> wen <hi>John</hi> fell <note place="margin">Rev. 19. 10. cap. 22. 9.</note> at his feet to worſhip him; <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66517:128"/> yet they give, and muſt give divine honour unto Chriſt. <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 9.</note> The Manhood of it ſelf could not be thus adored (becauſe it is a creature) but as it is received into unity of perſon with the Deity, and hath a partner agency therewith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its meaſure in the work of Redemption and Mediation. All the honour due to Chriſt according to his divine nature, was due from all eternity; and there is no divine honour due to him from and by reaſon of his humane nature; or any perfection which doth truly and properly belong to Chriſt as man. He who was born of <hi>Mary</hi> is to be adored with divine worſhip; but not for that reaſon, becauſe he was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> but becauſe he is God; the coeſſential and eternal Son of God. From what has been ſaid, we may thus argue; He to whom Religious worſhip is truly exhibited, is the moſt high God.

Now certainly if Jeſus Chriſt were not very God, he would never have laid claim to all that is the father's, as God. The Ancients inſiſt much upon that, <hi>Joh. 16. 15. All things that the father hath</hi> (as God) <hi>are mine:</hi> the father hath an eternal God-head, and that is mine; the Father hath infinite power and wiſdom, and that is mine; the father hath infinite majeſty and glory, and that is mine, the father hath infinite happineſs and bleſſedneſs in himſelf, and that is mine, ſaith Chriſt. The words are very emphatical, having in them a double U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality. 1. All things, there is one note of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality. 2. Whatſoever, there is another note of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality: we, ſaith Chriſt, there is nothing in the father (as God) but is mine, <hi>All that the father hath is mine;</hi> the father is God, and I am God; the father is life, and I am life; for whatſoever the father hath is mine; <hi>John 10. 30. I and my father are one;</hi> we are one eternal God, we are one in conſent, will, eſſence, nature, power, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66517:129"/> glory, <hi>&amp;c. I and my father are one;</hi> two perſons, but one God; he ſpeaketh this as he is God, one in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being and Deity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As God, he ſaith, <hi>I and my father are one;</hi> but <hi>ſecundum formam ſervi,</hi> in reſpect of the form of a ſervant (his aſſumed humanity) he ſaith, <hi>John 14. 28. My father is greater than I,</hi> John 10. 37. <hi>If I do not the works of my father, believe me not:</hi> verſ. 38. <hi>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works,</hi> &amp;c. The Argument of it ſelf is plain; No man can of himſelf, and by his own power, do divine works, unleſs he be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God: I do divine works by my own power, yea, <hi>I do the works of my father;</hi> not only the like and equal, but the ſame with the father: Therefore I am truly God: neither deſerve I to be called a Blaſphemer, becauſe I ſaid I was one with the father, 1 John 5. 7. <hi>And theſe three are one,</hi> one in nature and eſſence, one in power and will, and one in the act of producing all ſuch actions, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out themſelves any of them is ſaid to perform. Look as three Lamps are lighted in one chamber, albeit the Lamps be divers, yet the lights cannot be ſevered: ſo in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as there is a diſtinction of perſons, ſo a ſimplicity of nature. From the Scriptures laſt cited we may ſafely and confidently conclude that Chriſt hath the ſame divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Godhead with the father; they both have the ſame divine and eſſential Titles and Attributes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame inward operations in reference to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever. To make it yet more plain, compare <hi>John</hi> 17. 10. with <hi>John 16. 15. All things that the father hath are mine,</hi> John 16. 15. <hi>Father all mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> John 17. 10. That is, whatſoever doth belong to the father as God, doth belong to Chriſt; for we ſpeak not of perſonal but Eſſential Properties: Chriſt doth lay claim to all that is natural, to all that belongs to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as God; not to any thing which belongs to him as the father, as the firſt perſon of the bleſſed Trinity. <hi>All things that the father hath are mine:]</hi> This he ſpeaketh <note place="margin">John 1. 16. v.</note> in the perſon of the Mediator: <hi>becauſe of his fulneſs we all receive grace for grace;</hi> and herein ſheweth the unity of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66517:129"/> Eſſence in the holy Trinity, and community of Power, Wiſdom, Sanctity, Truth, Eternity, Glory, Majeſty: ſuch is the ſtrict union of the perſons of the bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there is among them a perfect communion in all things, for <hi>all things that the father hath are mine,</hi> And let thus much ſuffice for the proof of the Godhead of Chriſt.</p>

It is moſt certain, that in the work of man's Redemption Chriſt had no coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: He who did bear our ſins (that is, the puniſhments that were due to our ſins) in his own body on the Tree;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66517:132"/> he did aſſume fleſh caſt into the very mould and form of our bodies, having the ſame ſeveral parts, members, linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſame proportion which they have. Chriſt's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was no ſpectrum or phantaſm, no putative body (as if it had no being but what was in appearance and from imagination, as the Marcionites, Maniche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe ſtamps of diſhonour that the Jews had ſet upon Chriſt by wicked hands, thoſe he retained after his reſurrection, partly for the confirmation of his Apoſtles, and partly to work us to a willingneſs and reſoluteneſs to ſuffer for him when we are called to it, 1 <hi>John 1. 1.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66517:132"/> the Apoſtles had with Chriſt for about three years, and alſo to that touching, when after the Reſurrection, Chriſt offered himſelf to the Apoſtles that believed not in him to touch him. The truth of theſe things were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> to them by three ſenſes; hearing, ſeeing, handling, the latter ſtill ſurer than the former; and this proves Chriſt to be true man, as his being from the beginning, ſets out his Deity. Chriſt had alſo thoſe natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, paſſions, infirmities which are proper to a body, as hunger, <hi>Mat. 4. 2. When he had faſted forty days and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights, he was afterwards an hungerd.</hi> All Chriſt's Actions are for our inſtruction, not all for our imitation, <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſly makes mention of nights, leſt it ſhould be thought to be ſuch a faſt as that of the Jews, who faſted in the day, and did eat at the evening, and in the <note place="margin">Chemnit.</note> night. He would not extend his faſt above the term of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> leſt he ſhould have ſeemed to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only, and not to have been a true man; he was hungry, not becauſe his faſting wrought upon him, but <note place="margin">Hilar.</note> becauſe God le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t man to his own nature, It ſeems Chriſt felt no hunger till the forty days and forty nights were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, but was kept by the power of the Deity, as the three children (or rather Champions) from feeling the heat of <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 27.</note> the fire: Chriſt faſted forty days and forty nights, and not longer, leſt he might be thought not to have a true humane body, for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had faſted thus long before, but never did any man faſt longer. When Chriſt began to be hungry the tempter came to him, not when he was faſting; the Devil is cunning, and will take all the advantage he can upon us: during the forty days and forty nights, the Devil ſtood doubtful, and durſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Lord Jeſus, partly becauſe of that voice he heard from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>pleaſed,</hi> and partly becauſe his forty days and forty nights faſt did portend ſome great thing; but now, ſeeing Chriſt to be hungry, he impudently aſſaults him. Chriſt was not hungry all the forty days, but after he was hungry to ſhew he was man. Some think that Chriſt by his hunger
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66517:133"/> did objectively allure Satan to tempt him, that ſo he might overcome him, as ſouldiers ſometimes feign a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, that they may the better allure their enemies cloſely to purſue them, that ſo they may cut them off, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an Ambuſh, or by an orderly facing about: ſo the Devil tempted Chriſt as man, not knowing him to be God; or if he did know him to be God, Chriſt did as it were encourage his cowardly enemy that durſt not ſet upon him as God, ſhewing himſelf to be man. And as Chriſt was hungry, ſo Chriſt was thirſty, <hi>John 4. 7. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, give me to drink;</hi> here you ſee that he that is rich <note place="margin">2 Cor. S. 9. Pſal 104. 27. v.</note> and Lord of all became poor for us, that he might make us rich; and he that gives to all the creatures their meat in due ſeaſon, he begs water of a poor Tankerd-bearer to refreſh himſelf in his wearineſs and thirſt: <hi>John</hi> 19. 28. Jeſus ſaith I thirſt, bleeding breeds thirſting: ſleeping, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24. he was aſleep, to ſhew the truth of the humane nature, and the weakneſs of his Diſciples faith, Chriſt was in a faſt and dead ſleep (for ſo much the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies) his ſenſes were well and faſt bound, as if he had no operation of life, and therefore the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſaid to raiſe him, as it were from the dead. The ſame Greek word is uſed in many places where mention is made of the Reſurrection, as you may ſee by comparing <note place="margin">John 2. 19. Mat 27. 52. 1 Cor. 15. 12.</note> the Scriptures in the margent together. He was aſleep, 1. By reaſon of his labour in preaching and journey he ſlept; 2. To ſhew forth the truth of his humane nature: ſome think the Devil ſtirred up the ſtorm, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to drown Chriſt and his Diſciples, as he had deſtroyed <note place="margin">Job 1. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi>'s children in a Tempeſt before: but though Satan had malice and will enough to do it, yet he had not power; yea, though Chriſt ſlept in his humane nature, yet was he awake in his Deity; that the Diſciples being in danger might cry unto him more fervently, and be ſaved more remarkably. And as Jeſus ſlept, ſo he was alſo weary; <hi>John 4. 6. Now Jacob's well was there; Jeſus therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied with his journey, ſat thus on the well: and it was</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:66517:133"/> 
               <hi>about the ſixth hour,</hi> about noon: in the heat of the day Chriſt was weary, Chriſt took on him not only our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the common infirmities thereof, and he is to be as ſeriouſly eyed in his humanity, as in the glory of his Godhead; therefore it is recorded, that he was weary with his journey ere half the day was ſpent; and that through wearineſs <hi>he ſat thus on the well;</hi> that is, even as the ſeat offered, or as weary men uſe to ſit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in a word, he was conceived, retained ſo long in the Virgins womb, born, circumciſed, lived about thirty years on earth, converſed all that time with men, ſuffered, died, and was crucified, buried, roſe again, aſcended, and ſat down with his body at the right hand of God, and with it will come again to judg the world. Now what do all theſe things ſpeak out, but that Chriſt hath a true body, and who in their wits will aſſert, that all this could be done in, and upon, and by an imaginary body. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſeveral denominations that are given <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to Jeſus Chriſt in Scripture do clearly evidence the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reality of his humane nature; he is called, 1.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66517:134"/> 
               <hi>How ſay the Scribes, that Chriſt is the ſon of David?</hi> In that the Scribes and Phariſees knew and acknowledged, according to the Scripture that Chriſt ſhould be the ſon of <hi>David;</hi> that is, ſhould be born, and deſcend of the ſtock and poſterity of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh. Hence we may eaſily gather the truth of Chriſt's humane nature, that he was ordained of God to be true man as well as God, in one and the ſame perſon; for elſe he could not be the ſon of <hi>David.</hi> Now, that he muſt be the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> even the Scribes and the Phariſees knew and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, as we ſee here; and this was a truth which they had learned out of the Scriptures; and not only they, but even the common ſort of Jews in our Saviour's time, <hi>John</hi> 7. 42. ſome of the common people ſpake thus, <hi>Hath not the ſcripture ſaid that Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi> and the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was then commonly called the ſon <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 3.</note> of <hi>David:</hi> ſo then Chriſt being of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, he muſt needs be true man, as well as God; for which cauſe he was incarnate in the due time appointed of God; that is to ſay, he being the ſon of God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, did in time become man; taking our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, together with the infirmities of our nature, ſin only excepted, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. Now thus you ſee that the 18 denominations that are given to Chriſt in the bleſſed Scriptures do abundantly demonſtrate the certainty of Chriſt's humane nature. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt took the whole humane nature, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> was truly and compleatly man, conſiſting of fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, body and ſoul; yea, that he aſſumed the entire hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, with whatever is proper to it; Chriſt took to himſelf the whole humane nature, in both the eſſential parts of man, ſoul and body, the two eſſential and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive parts of man are ſoul and body, where theſe two are, there's the true man; now Chriſt had both, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was true man.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt had a true humane and reaſonable ſoul, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reaſonable ſoul is the higheſt and nobleſt part of man; this is that which principally makes the man, and hath the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66517:134"/> greateſt influence into his being and eſſence, if therefore Jeſus Chriſt had only a humane body without a humane ſoul, he had wanted that part which is moſt eſſential to man, and ſo he could not have been looked upon as true and perfect man. O Sirs, Chriſt redeemed and ſaved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he aſſumed; the redemption and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reach no farther than the aſſumption, our ſoul then would have been never the better for Chriſt, had he not taken that as well as our body: Hence ſaid <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aug de civ. Dei. lib. 10. c. 27. p. 586</note> Therefore he took the whole man without ſin, that he might heal the whole; of which man conſiſts, of the plague of ſin. And <hi>Fulgentius</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, As <note place="margin">Fulgent ad Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymund. lib. 1. p. 251.</note> the Devil ſmote by deceiving the whole man, ſo God ſaves by aſſuming the whole man: If he will ſave the whole man from ſin, he will aſſume the whole man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> The Scriptures do clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that Chriſt had a real humane ſoul, <hi>Mat. 26. 38. My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death;</hi> every word is emphatical; <hi>my ſoul,</hi> his ſorrows pierced his ſoul, <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 16.</note> and ſorrowful round about, even to death, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>heavy round about:</hi> Look as the ſoul was the firſt Agent in tranſgreſſion, ſo it is here the firſt Patient in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; <hi>to death,</hi> that is, this ſorrow will never be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or intermitted but by death: <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,</hi> then Chriſt had a true humane ſoul, neither was his Deity to him for a ſoul, as of old, men of corrupt minds have fancied; for then our bodies only had been redeemed by him, and not our ſouls, if he had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in ſoul as well as in body. The ſufferings of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were but the body of his ſufferings, the ſoul of his ſufferings were the ſufferings of his ſoul, which was now beſet with ſorrows, and heavy as heart could hold, <hi>John 12. 27. Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay,</hi> The Greek word ſignifies a vehement commotion and perturbation, as <hi>Herod</hi>'s mind was troubled when he <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 3.</note> heard that a new King was born, or as the Diſciples were <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 26.</note> troubled when they thought they ſaw a ſpirit walking on the ſea, and cryed out for fear; or as <hi>Zachary</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 12.</note>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:66517:135"/> at the ſudden ſight of the Angel. The riſe and cauſe of Chriſt's ſoul-trouble was this, the Godhead hiding it ſelf from the humanitie's ſenſe; and the father letting out, not only an apprehenſion of his ſufferings to come, but a preſent taſte of the horrour of his wrath, due to man for ſin; he is amazed, overwhelmed, and perplexed with it in his humanity; and no wonder ſince he had the ſins of all the Elect laid upon him by imputation, to ſuffer for. And ſo this wrath is not let out againſt his perſon, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſins which were laid on him. Now though Chriſt was here troubled or jumbled and puzzled, as the word imports; yet we are not to conceive that there was any ſin in this exerciſe of his, for he was like clean water in a clean veſſel, which being never ſo often ſtirred and ſhaken, yet ſtill keeps clean and clear: neither are we to think it ſtrange, that the ſon of God ſhould be put to ſuch perplexities in this trouble, as not to know what to ſay; for conſidering him as man, encompaſſed with our ſinleſs infirmities; and that this heavy weight of wrath did light upon him on a ſudden, it is no wonder that it did confound all his thoughts as man, O Sirs, look that as ſin hath infected both the ſouls and bodies of the Elect, and chiefly their ſouls, where it hath its chief ſeat; ſo Chriſt to expiate this ſin, did ſuffer unſpeakable ſorrows and trouble in his ſoul as well as torture in his body; <hi>for my ſoul is troubled,</hi> ſaith he. Though ſome ſufferings of the body be very exquiſite and painful, and Chriſt's in particular were ſuch; yet ſad trouble of mind is far more grievous than any bodily diſtreſs, as Chriſt alſo found, who ſilently bare all his outward troubles, but yet could not but cry out of his inward trouble, <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, Iſa. 53. 10. Thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin;</hi> when Chriſt ſuffered for us our ſins were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa. 53. 7. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</note> him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. 6. as by the Law of ſacrificing of old, the ſinner was to lay his hands upon the head of the beaſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit. 8. 14. 18. 22. v.</hi>
               </note> confeſſing his ſins, and then the beaſt was ſlain, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for expiation; thus having the man's ſins as it were taken and put upon it, and hereby the ſinner is made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66517:135"/> The ſinner could never be pardoned, nor the guilt of ſin removed, but by Chriſt's making his ſoul an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin; what did Chriſt in ſpecial recommend to God, when he was breathing out his laſt gaſp but his ſoul? <hi>Luk. 23. 46. When Jeſus had cried out with a loud voice he ſaid, father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit; and having ſaid thus he gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> that is, to thy ſafe cuſtody, and bleſſed tuition I commend my ſoul, as a ſpecial treaſure or Jewel moſt charily and tenderly to be preſerved and kept, <hi>Luke 2. 52. He increaſed in wiſdom and ſtature,</hi> here's ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his body, and wiſdom for his ſoul; his growth in that ſpeaks the truth of the former, and his growth in this the truth of the latter: his body properly could not grow in wiſdom, nor his ſoul in ſtature, therefore he muſt have both. There are two eſſential parts which make up one of his natures, his Manhood, <hi>viz.</hi> ſoul and body, but both of theſe two of old have been denyed. <hi>Marcion</hi> diveſts Chriſt of a body, and <hi>Apollinaris</hi> of a ſoul; and the Arrians held that Chriſt had no ſoul, but that the Deity was to him inſtead of a ſoul, and ſupplyed the office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that what the ſoul is to us, and doth in our bodies, all that the divine nature was to Chriſt, and did in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and are there not ſome among us, that make a great noiſe about a light in them that daſh upon the ſame rock? but the choice Scriptures laſt cited, may ſerve ſufficiently to confute all ſuch brain-ſick men. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, as Chriſt had a true humane and reaſonable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſoul, ſo Chriſt had a perfect, entire, compleat body, and every thing which is proper to a body; for inſtance, 1. he had blood, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. He alſo took part of the ſame,</hi> that is, of fleſh and blood, Chriſt had in him the blood of a man, ſhedding of blood there muſt be, for without it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22.</note> there is no remiſſion of ſin; the blood of bruit creatures <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 10. v.</note> could not waſh away the blots of reaſonable creatures; wherefore Chriſt took our nature, that he might have our blood to ſhed for our ſins. There is an Emphaſis put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt as man, in the great buſineſs of man's ſalvation, <hi>The Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> the remedy carrying in it a ſuitable <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</note>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:66517:136"/> neſs to the Malady, the ſufferings of a man to expiate the ſin of man. 2. He had bones as well as fleſh, <hi>Luk. 24. 39. A ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> 3. Chriſt had in him the bowels of a man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. which bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els he fully expreſſed when he was on earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20. nay he retaineth thoſe bowels now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in glory he hath a fellow feeling of his people's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, <hi>Acts 9. 4. Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35. to the end of that chapter; though Chriſt in his glorified ſtate be freed from that ſtate of frailty, paſſibility, Mortality, yet he ſtill retains his wonted pity. 4. He had in him the familiarity of a man, how familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did Chriſt converſe with all ſorts of perſons in this world, all the Evangeliſts do ſufficiently teſtifie. Man is a ſociable and familiar creature; Chriſt became man <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.</note> that he might be a merciful High Prieſt: Not that his becoming man made him more merciful, as though the mercies of a man were more than the mercies of God, but becauſe by this means mercy is conveyed more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and familiarly to man. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt took our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> infirmities upon him; when Chriſt was in this world he ſubmitted to the common accidents, adjuncts, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, miſeries, calamities, which are incident to humane nature. For the opening of this remember there are three ſorts of infirmities; 1. There are ſinful infirmities, <hi>Jam. 5. 7. Pſal.</hi> 77. 10. the beſt of men are but men at the beſt; witneſs <hi>Abraham</hi>'s unbelief, <hi>David</hi>'s ſecurity, <hi>Job</hi>'s curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">

               <hi>Jonas</hi> his paſſion, <hi>Thomas</hi> his unbelief, <hi>Peter</hi>'s lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe infirmities Jeſus Chriſt took not upon him; for though he was made like unto us in all things, yet without ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. 2. There are perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which from ſome particular cauſes befall this or that perſon; as Leproſie, blindneſs, dumbneſs, Palſie, Dropſie, Epilepſie, Stone, Gout, Sickneſs; Chriſt was never ſick, ſickneſs ariſes from the unfit or unequal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the humours, or from intemperance of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſtudy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but none of theſe were in Chriſt, he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66517:136"/> had no ſin, and therefore no ſickneſs; Chriſt took not the paſſions or infirmities which were proper to this or that man. 3. There are natural infirmities which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all Mankind ſince the fall; as hunger, thirſt, weariſomneſs; ſorrowfulneſs, ſweating, bleeding, wounds, death, burial; now theſe natural infirmities that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole nature; theſe Jeſus Chriſt took upon him, as all the Evangeliſts do abundantly teſtifie: our dear Lord Jeſus he lay ſo many weeks and months in the Virgin's womb, he received nouriſhment and growth in the ordinary way, he was brought forth and bred up juſt as common infants are, he had his life ſuſtained by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon food as ours is; he was poor, afflicted, reproached, perſecuted, tempted, deſerted, falſely accuſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he lived an afflicted life, and died an accurſed death; his whole life from the cradle to the croſs was made up of nothing but ſorrows and ſufferings; and thus you ſee that Jeſus Chriſt did put himſelf under thoſe infirmities which properly belong to the common nature of man, though he did not take upon him the particular infirmities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuums. Now what do all theſe things ſpeak out, but the certainty and reality of Chriſt's Manhood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que.</hi> But why muſt Chriſt partake of both natures, was it abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould ſo do; <hi>An.</hi> Yea, it was abſolutely neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould partake of both natures; and that both in reſpect of God, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us: Firſt in reſpect of us; and that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe man had ſinned, and therefore man muſt <note place="margin">1. 1 Cor. 15. 21.</note> be puniſhed; by man came death, therefore by man muſt come the reſurrection of the dead; man was the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, therefore man muſt be the ſatisfier; man had been the ſinner, and therefore man muſt be the ſufferer: it is but juſtice to puniſh ſin in that nature, in which it had been committed: by man we fell from God, and by man we muſt be brought back to God; by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were ruined, by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> we muſt be repaired. The <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> humane nature was to be redeemed, therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66517:137"/> that the humane nature ſhould be aſſumed: The Law was given to man, and the Law was broken by man, and therefore it was neceſſary that the Law ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by man. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, that by this means the juſtice of God might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be ſatisfied in the ſame nature which had ſinned, which was the nature of man: Angels could not ſatisfie divine juſtice, becauſe they had no bodies to ſuffer; the brutiſh ſenſible creatures could not ſatisfie the juſtice of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no ſouls to ſuffer; the ſenſible creatures could not ſatisfie divine juſtice, becauſe they had no ſenſe to ſuffer: therefore man having body, ſoul, and ſenſe muſt do it; for he had ſinned in all, and he could ſuffer in all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there are reaſons both in reſpect of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in reſpect of our ſelves, why Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be God, and God-man alſo, and they are theſe five;</p>
            <p>Firſt, that he might be a meet Mediator between God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and man; Chriſt's office, as Mediator, was to deal with God for man, and to deal for God with man. Now that he might be ſit for both theſe tranſactions, for both parts of this office, he muſt partake of both natures. That he might effectually deal with God for man, he muſt be God, <hi>(If a man ſin againſt the Lord who ſhall entreat for him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eli</hi> to his ſons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25.) And that he might deal for God with man, he muſt be man: He muſt be God that he may be fit to tranſact, treat, and negotiate with God; and he muſt be man, that he may be fit, to tranſact, treat, and negotiate with man: when God ſpake unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the giving of the Law, the people were not able to abide that voice or preſence, and therefore they deſired an Internuncius, a man like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who might be as a Mediator to go betwixt God and them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 18, 19. Now upon his very ground <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 18.</note> beſides many others that might be mentioned, it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be both God and man, <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 18.</note> that he might be a meet Mediator to deal betwixt God and man. Jeſus Chriſt was the fitteſt perſon either in that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66517:137"/> upper or in this lower world to mediate between God and us. There was none fit to umpeire the buſineſs between God and man but he that was God-man: <hi>Job</hi> hit the nail when he ſaid, <hi>Neither is there any days-man betwixt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job. 9. 33.</note> 
               <hi>us that might lay his hand upon us both:</hi> There was a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe of the days-man, and his laying his hand upon them; 1. To keep the diſſening parties aſunder, leſt they ſhould fall out, and ſtrike one another: 2. To keep them together, and compoſe all differences, that they might not depart from each other; the Application is eaſie, man is not fit to mediate, becauſe man is the perſon offending; Angels are not fit to mediate, for they cannot ſatisfie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, nor pacifie divine wrath, nor procure our pardon, nor make our peace, nor bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs upon us; God the father was not fit for this work, for he was the perſon offended; and he was as much too high to deal with man, as man was too low to deal with God: The holy Ghoſt was not fit for this work, for 'tis his work to apply this Mediation, and to clear up the believers intereſt in this Mediation. So then there is no other perſon fit for this office, but Jeſus Chriſt, who was a middle perſon, 'twixt both, that he might deal with both: Chriſt could never have been fit to be the Mediator in reſpect of his office, if he had not firſt been a middle perſon in reſpect of his natures; for (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Gal. 3. 20. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one; A mediator is not a mediator of one,</hi> that is of one party, but is always of two differing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to unite them; <hi>not of one,</hi> that is, 1. Not of one perſon, becauſe mediation implies more perſons than one it neceſſarily ſuppoſes different parties betwixt whom he doth mediate; Chriſt (to ſpeak after the manner of men) lays his hand upon God the father, and ſaith, O bleſſed father, wilt thou be at peace with theſe poor ſinners? wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou pardon them? and wilt thou lift up the light of thy countenance upon them? if thou wilt, then I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſatisfie thy juſtice, and to pacifie thy wrath, and to fulfil thy royal Law, and to make good all the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66517:138"/> wrong they have done againſt thee. And then he layeth his hand upon the poor ſinner; and ſaith, ſinner, art thou willing to be changed and renewed? art thou willing to come under the bond of the covenant? art thou willing to give up thy heart and life to the guidance and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirit? then be not diſcouraged, for thou ſhalt certainly be juſtified and ſaved. 2. Not of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Mediator muſt neceſſarily have more natures than one, he muſt have the divine and humane nature u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in his ſingle perſon, or elſe he could never ſuffer what he was to ſuffer, nor never ſatisfie what he was to ſatisfie, nor never bring poor ſinners into a ſtate of reconciliation <note place="margin">2 Cor 5. 19, 20.</note> with God: and 'tis farther obſervable, that the Text laſt cited ſaith, <hi>God is one, (viz.)</hi> as he is eſſentially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore as ſo he cannot be the Mediator; but Chriſt, as perſonally conſidered, he <hi>is not of one</hi> (that is) not of one nature, for he is God and man too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is the only perſon that is fitted and qualified to be the Mediator: and 'tis obſervable that when Chriſt is ſpoken of as Mediator, his Manhood is brought in (that nature being ſo neceſſary to that office,) 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was God and man; as man he ought to ſatisfie, but could not; as God he could ſatisfie, but ought not: but conſider him as God and man, and ſo he both could ſatisfie, and ought to ſatisfie, and accordingly he did ſatisfie, according to what was prophecied of him, <hi>Dan. 9. 24. He did make reconciliation for iniquity, and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs:</hi> He did not begin to do ſomething, and then faint, and leave his work imperfect, but he finiſhed it, and that to the glory of his father, <hi>John 17. 4. I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> And 'tis good to obſerve the ſingularity and oneneſs of the perſon mediating; not many, not a few, not two, but one Mediator between God and man, there was none with him in his difficult work of Mediatorſhip, but he carried it on alone; though there are many Mediators among men,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66517:138"/> yet there is but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>a Mediator,</hi> is a middle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or one that interpoſes betwixt two parties at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to make peace betwixt them. Though <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth moſt properly ſignifie a Mediator or a midler, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is both a middle perſon, and a middle officer betwixt God and man, to reconcile and reunite God and man. This of all others is the moſt proper and genuine ſignification of this name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Jeſus Chriſt is the middle, that is, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, betwixt the Father and the Holy Ghoſt: He is the only middle perſon betwixt God and man, being in one perſon God-man; and his being a middle perſon fits and capacitates him to ſtand in the midſt between God and us. And as he is the middle perſon, ſo he is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle officer, intervening, or interpoſing, or coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man by office, ſatisfying God's juſtice to the full for man's ſins by his ſufferings and death, and maintaining our conſtant peace in heaven by his meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interceſſion. Hence, as one obſerves, Jeſus Chriſt is <note place="margin">Gerhard.</note> a true Mediator, is ſtill found, <hi>in medio, in the middle.</hi> He was born, as ſome think, from <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 18. 14. about the middle of the night, he ſuffered in the middle of the world, that is, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeated in the middle of the <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 12.</note> earth: he was crucified in the midſt, between the two <note place="margin">John 19. 18.</note> thieves: he died in the air on the croſs, in the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66517:139"/> heaven and earth: he ſtood after his Reſurrection <note place="margin">John 20. 19.</note> in the midſt of his Diſciples: and he has promiſed, that where two or three are gathered together in his name, he <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> will be in the midſt of them: and he walks in the midſt <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 1.</note> of the ſeven golden candle-ſticks, that is, the Churches: And he as the heart in the midſt of the body; diſtributes <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 15, 16.</note> ſpirits and vertue to all the parts of his myſtical body. Thus Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator betwixt God and man; middle in perſon, and middle in office. And thus you have ſeen at large what a meet Mediator Jeſus Chriſt is, conſidered in both his natures, conſidered as God-man. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Jeſus Chriſt be not God, then there is no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nor eternal good to be expected or enjoyed: If Chriſt be not God, our preaching is in vain, and your hearing is in vain, and your praying is in vain, and your believing is in vain, and your hope of pardon and forgivneſs by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in vain, for none can forgive ſins but a God: <note place="margin">Mark 2. 7. John 3. 16. John 10. 28. 2 Tim. 4. 8. James 1. 12. 1 Pet. 5. 4. v. Rev. 3. 21. Rev. 2. 11.</note> Chriſt hath promiſed that believers ſhall never periſh, he hath promiſed them eternal life, and that he will raiſe them up at the laſt day, he has promiſed a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he has promiſed a Crown of Life, he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a Crown of glory, he has promiſed that conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians ſhall ſit down with him in his throne, as he is ſet down with his father in his throne: He has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death. And a thouſand other good things Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed; but if Jeſus Chriſt be not God, how ſhall theſe promiſes be made good? If a man that hath never a foot of Land in <hi>England,</hi> nor yet worth one groat in all the world, ſhall make his will, and bequeath to thee ſuch and ſuch houſes, and Lands, and Lordſhips in ſuch a County, or ſuch a County; and ſhall by Will, give thee ſo much in Plate, and ſo much in Jewels, and ſo much in ready money; whereas he is not, upon any account, worth one penny in all the world; certainly ſuch Legacies will never make a man the richer nor the happier. None of thoſe great and precious promiſes, which are hinted at above will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66517:139"/> any thing, if Chriſt be not God; for they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refreſh us, nor chear us in this world, nor make us happy in that other world. If Chriſt be not God how can he purchaſe our pardon, procure our peace, pacifie divine wrath, and ſatisfie infinite juſtice: A man may ſatisfie the juſtice of man, but who but a God can ſatisfie the juſtice of God? will God accept of thouſands of <note place="margin">Micah 6. 7.</note> Rams. or ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl, or the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of thy body for the ſin of thy ſoul? Oh? No, he will not, he cannot; that Scripture is worthy to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in letters of Gold, <hi>Acts 20. 28. Take heed, therefore, unto your ſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers; to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood:</hi> This muſt needs relate to Chriſt, and Chriſt is here called God, and Chriſt's blood is called the blood of God, and without a peradventure Chriſt could never have gone through with the purchaſe of the Church, if the blood he ſhed had not been the blood of God. This blood is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God's own blood, becauſe the ſon of God, being and remaining true God, aſſumed humane fleſh and blood in unity of perſon: by this phraſe that which appertaineth to the humanity of Chriſt, is attributed to his Divinity, becauſe of the union of the two natures in one perſon, and communion of properties. The Church is to Chriſt a bloody Spouſe, an <hi>Acheldama</hi> or field of blood: for the could not be redeemed with ſilver and gold, but with <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> the blood of God: ſo it is called by a communication of properties, to ſet forth the incomparable value and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Chriſt be not God, yea God-man, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we ſhall never be able to anſwer all the challenges that either divine Juſtice or Satan can make upon us; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the juſtice of God can exact, that the blood of God can diſcharge: now the blood of Chriſt is the blood of God, as I have evidenced in the ſecond Reaſon: by reaſon of the hypoſtatical union, the humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united to the divine, the humane nature did ſuffer,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66517:140"/> the Divine did ſatisfie: Chriſt's Godhead did give both Majeſty and Eſſicacy to his ſufferings; Chriſt was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Prieſt, and Altar: He was Sacrifice as he was man, Prieſt as he was God and man, and Altar as he was God. it is the property of the Altar to ſanctifie the thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 19.</note> on it; ſo the Altar of Chriſt's divine nature, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the ſacrifice of his death, and made it meritorious, Man ſinned, and therefore man muſt ſatisfie: Therefore the humane nature muſt be aſſumed by a ſurety, for man cannot do it: If an Angel ſhould have aſſumed humane nature, it would have polluted him: Humane nature was ſo defiled by ſin, that it could not be aſſumed by any but God: Now Chriſt being God, the Divine nature purified the Humane nature which he took, and ſo it was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſacrifice, The perſon offered in ſacrifice being God as well as man. This is a moſt noble ground upon which a believer may challenge Satan to ſay his worſt, and to do his worſt; let him preſent God as terrible, yea, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> fire: let him preſent me as odious and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Zecha. 3. 2, 3.</note> in the ſight of God as once he did <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> let him preſent me before the Lord as vile and mercenary as once he did <hi>Job,</hi> let him aggravate the heighth of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, <note place="margin">Job 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> and the heighth, and depth, and length, and breadth of my ſins; I ſhall readily grant all, and againſt all this I will ſet the infinite ſatisfaction of dear Jeſus: this I know, that though the juſtice of God cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor bribed, yet it may be ſatisfied. Here is a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ſatisfaction, here is God anſwering God. 'Tis a very noble plea of the Apoſtle, <hi>who is he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> 
               <hi>it is Chriſt that died;</hi> let Satan urge the juſtice of God as much as he can, I am ſure that the juſtice of God <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> makes me ſure of Salvation, and the reaſon is evident, becauſe his juſtice obligeth him to accept of an adequate ſatisfaction of his own appointing: The juſtice of God maketh me ſure of mine own happineſs, becauſe if God be juſt, that ſatisfaction ſhould be had; when that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is made, Juſtice requireth that the perſon for whom it is made, ſhall be received into favour. I confeſs, that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66517:140"/> unleſs God had obliged himſelf by promiſe, there were no preſſing his juſtice thus far, becauſe <hi>Noxa ſequitur ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put.</hi> There was mercy in the promiſe of ſending Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

Here cometh in mercy, that a ſurety ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and what he doth is as if the perſon that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould have done it himſelf. Here is mercy and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſurely bottomed upon both: ah what ſweet and tranſcendent comfort flows from this very conſideration, That Chriſt is God. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the great and glorious majeſty of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it, that Chriſt ſhould be God: God the father being a God of infinite holineſs, purity, juſtice and righteouſneſs, none but he who was very God, who was eſſentially one with the father, could or durſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">John 10. 30. cap. 14. 9, 10, 11. &amp;c.</note> between God and fallen man. The Angels, though they are glorious creatures, yet they are but creatures; and could theſe ſatisfie divine juſtice, and bear infinite wrath, and purchaſe divine favour, and reconcile us to God, and procure our pardon, and change our hearts, and renew our natures, and adorn our ſouls with Grace?
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66517:141"/> and yet all theſe things muſt be done or we undone, and that for ever. Now if this were a work too high for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, then we may ſafely conclude, that it was a work too hard for fallen man.

            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, that Chriſt's ſufferings and merits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> might be ſufficient, it was abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould be God. The ſin of man was infinite (I mean in finitely puniſhable) if not infinite in number, yet infinite in nature, every offence being infinite, it being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt an infinite God. No creature could therefore ſatisfie for it, but the ſufferer muſt be God, that ſo his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs might be anſwerable to the infiniteneſs of men's offences. There was an abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt's ſufferings, partly becauſe he was pleaſed to ſubſtitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſinner's ſtead, and partly becauſe his ſufferings only could be ſatisfactory. Now unleſs he had been man how could he ſuffer, and unleſs he had been God, how could he ſatisfie offended Juſtice: Look as he muſt be more than man, that he may be able to ſuffer, that his ſufferings may be meritorious; ſo he muſt be man, that he may be in a capacity to ſuffer, die, and obey, for theſe are no work for one who is only God. A God only can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer, a man only cannot merit; God cannot obey, man is bound to obey; wherefore Chriſt, that he might
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66517:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> obey and ſuffer, he was man; and that he might merit by his obedience and ſuffering, he was God-man; juſt ſuch a perſon did the work of Redemption call for. That Chriſt's merits might be ſufficient he muſt be God, for ſufficient merit for Mankind could not be in the perſon of any mere man, no not in Chriſt himſelf conſidered only as man; for ſo all the grace he had he did receive it, and all the good he did he was bound to do it; for, he was made of a woman, and made under the Law (not only <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> under the Ceremonial Law as he was a Jew, but under the Moral as a man, for it is under that Law under which we were, and from which we are redeemed) therefore <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> in fulfilling it, he did no more than that which was his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do; he could not merit by it, no not for himſelf, much leſs for others (conſidered only as man) therefore he muſt alſo be God, that the dignity of his perſon might add dignity, and vertue, and value to his works: in a word, <hi>Deus potuit, ſed non debuit; homo debuit, ſed non potuit: God could, but he ſhould not; man ſhould, but he could not</hi> make ſatisfaction: therefore he that would do it muſt be both God and man: <hi>Torris erutus ab igne</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) <hi>Is not this a fire-brand taken out of the fire?</hi> you know that in a fire-brand taken out of the fire, there is fire and wood inſeparably mixed, and in Chriſt there is God and man wonderfully united. He was God, elſe neither his ſufferings nor his merits could have been ſufficient; and if his could not, much leſs any man's elſe: for all other men are both conceived and born in Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, and alſo much and often defiled with actual ſin, and therefore we ought for ever to abhor all ſuch popiſh Doctrines, Prayers, and Maſſes for the dead, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt mans merits, man's ſatisfaction. <hi>For, no man can by</hi>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66517:143"/> by him; Chriſt took not a part, but the whole nature of man; that is, a true humane ſoul and body, together with all the eſſential properties and faculties of both: that in man's nature he might die, and ſuffer the wrath of God, and whole curſe due to our ſins, which otherwiſe <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> being God only, he could never have done; and that he might ſatisfie divine juſtice for ſin, in the ſame nature that had ſinned, and indeed it was moſt meet and fit, that the Mediator, who was to reconcile God and man, ſhould partake in the natures of both parties to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. Oh, what matchleſs love was this, that made our dear Lord Jeſus, to lay by for a time all that glory, that he <note place="margin">John 17. 5.</note> had with the father before the world was, and to aſſume our nature, and to be found in faſhion as a man, to ſee <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> the great God in the form of a ſervant, or hanging upon the Croſs, how wonderful and aſtoniſhing was it to all that believed him to be God-man; God manifeſted in <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 11.</note> our fleſh is an amazing myſtery, a myſtery fit for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Angels, that the eternal God ſhould become <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> the man Chriſt Jeſus, that a moſt glorious Creator ſhould <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9, 13, 22.

It would have ſeemed a high blaſphemy for us to have thought of ſuch a thing, or to have deſired ſuch a thing, or to have ſpoken of ſuch a thing, if God in his everlaſting Goſpel had not reveiled ſuch a thing to us: Among the Romiſh Prieſts, Friars, Jeſuits, they count it a great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, an high honour that is done to any of their orders, when any Noble man or great Prince (who is weary of the world, and the world weary of him) comes among them, and takes any of their habits upon him, and lives and dies in their habits: Oh, what a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Chriſt's love is it! and what a mighty honour hath Jeſus Chriſt put upon mankind, in that he took our nature upon him, in that he lived in our nature, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our nature, and roſe in our nature, and aſcended

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66517:144"/> was a mighty work; wherefore was Chriſt born, wherefore did he live, ſweat, groan, bleed, die, riſe, aſcend; was it not to bring deliverance to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound? was it not to make an end of ſin, to finiſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and to aboliſh death, and to bring life and immortality to light, and to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie us to himſelf, and to make us a peculiar peple zealous of good works? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the work of Redemption was no ordinary or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing; God-man muſt engage in it, or poor fallen man is undone for ever. The greater the perſon is that is engaged in any work, the greater is that work: the great Monarchs of the world do not uſe to engage their ſons in poor, low, mean, and petty ſervices, but in ſuch ſervices as are high and honourable, noble and weighty: and will you imagine that ever the great and glorious God <note place="margin">John 1. 18. 8. Pro. 22.—33</note> would have ſent his ſon, his own ſon, his only begotten ſon, his boſom ſon, his ſon in whom his ſoul delighted before the foundations of the earth was laid; to redeem poor ſinners ſouls, if this had not been a great work, a high work, and a moſt glorious work in his eye. The Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world did but coſt God a word of his mouth; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> but the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> of ſouls coſt him his deareſt ſon, there is a divine great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtamp'd upon the works of providence, but what are the works of Providence to the work of Redemption? what are all providential works to Chriſt's coming from heaven, to his being incarnate, to his doings, ſufferings, and dying, and all this to ranſom poor ſouls from the curſe, hell, wrath, and eternal death? ſouls are dear and coſtly things, and of great price in the ſight of God.

               <hi>that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation, received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but with the precious blood of the ſon of God, as of a lamb without a ſpot.</hi> Chriſt that only went to the price of ſouls, hath told us that one ſoul is more worth than <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> all the world: Chriſt left his father's boſom, and all the glory of heaven for the good of ſouls, he aſſumed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man for the happineſs of the ſoul of man, he trod the Wine-preſs of his father's wrath for ſouls, he wept for ſouls, he ſwet for ſouls, he prayed for ſouls, he payed for ſouls, and he bled out his heart-blood for the redemption of ſouls. The ſoul is the breath of God, the beauty of man, the wonder of Angels, and the envy of Devils: 'tis of an Angelical nature, 'tis a heavenly ſpark, a celeſtial plant, and of a divine off-ſpring; 'tis capable of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, of union with God, of communion with <note place="margin">John 14. 8. Pſal. 17. 15.</note> God, and of an eternal fruition of God; there is nothing that can ſuit the ſoul below God, there is nothing that can ſatisfie the ſoul without God; the ſoul is ſo high and ſo noble a piece that it ſcorns all the world; what are all the riches of the Eaſt or Weſt-<hi>Indies?</hi> what are Rocks of Diamonds, or Mountains of Gold? or the price of <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra's</hi> draught, to the price that Chriſt laid down for ſouls?

Ah, for what a thing of nought do many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſell their ſouls to Satan every day! how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are there who ſwear, curſe, lye, cheat, deceive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a little gain every day!

            <p>Fourthly, is Jeſus Chriſt God-man? is he very God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and very man? then let this encourage poor ſinners to come to Chriſt, to cloſe with Chriſt, to accept of Chriſt, to match into Chriſt, and to enter with a marriage u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and communion with Chriſt. The great work of Goſpel Miniſters is like that of <hi>Eliezer, Abraham</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> to ſeek a match for our maſter's ſon: now our way to win you to him, is not only to tell you what he has, but what he is; now he is God-man in one perſon, he is man that you may not be afraid of him, and he is God <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25. Rev. 1. 5. cap. 17. 14. Heb. 1. 3. Pſal. 45. 1. Cant. 5. 10. 16.</note> that he may be able to ſave you to the uttermoſt, he is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings, he is the heir of all things, he is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Children of men, he is the chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, he is altogether lovely, there is every thing in Jeſus who is God-man to encourage you to come to him: If you look upon his names, if you look upon his natures, if you look upon his offices, if you look upon his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if you look upon his perſonal excellencies, if you look upon his mighty conqueſts, if you look upon his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66517:146"/> Royal attendance; all theſe things call aloud upon you, to come to Chriſt, to cloſe with Chriſt: if you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great things that he has done for ſinners, and the hard things that he has ſuffered for ſinners, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things that he has prepared and laid up for ſinners; how can you but readily accept of him, and ſweetly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him: Though thou haſt no lovelineſs nor comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 4. 5.

Oh ſirs, what could Chriſt have done that he has not done to do you good, and to make you happy for ever? Loe, he has laid aſide his glorious Robes, and he has put on your Rags, he has cloathed himſelf with your fleſh, he came off from his Royal Throne, he humbled himſelf to the death of the Croſs, and has brought Life, Immortality, and Glory to your very doors, and will you yet ſtand out againſt him? Oh how ſhall ſuch eſcape who neglect ſo great ſalvation, who ſay, this man <note place="margin">Hel. 2. 3. Luk. 19. 14.</note> ſhall not rule over us, who tread under foot the ſon of God! Oh what wrath, what great wrath, what pure <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 28.

Ah ſinners, ſinners, that you would labour to underſtand more, and dwell more upon the preheminent excellencies of Chriſt; for till the ſoul can diſcern a better, a greater excellency in Chriſt than in any
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66517:146"/> other thing, it will never yield to match with Chriſt: Oh labour every day more and more to take the heigth, and depth, and breadth of the excellency of Chriſt. He is the chiefeſt and the choiceſt of all, both in that upper, and in this lower world. The Godhead dwells bodily in him, he is full of grace, he is the heir of glory, the holy one of God, the brightneſs of his father's Image, the fountain of life, the well of ſalvation, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of heaven. Oh, when will you ſo underſtand the ſuperlative excellency of Chriſt, as to fall in love with him, as to cry out with the Martyr, O none but Chriſt, O none to Chriſt? It is your wiſdom, it is your duty, it is your ſafety, it is your glory, it is your ſalvation, it is your all to accept of Chriſt, to cloſe with Chriſt, and to beſtow your ſelves, your ſouls, your all on Chriſt; if you embrace him you are made for ever, but if you reject him you periſh for ever, <hi>Bernard</hi> calls Chriſt <hi>Sponſus ſanguinum, the Bridegroom of Bloods,</hi> becauſe he eſpouſed his Church to himſelf upon the bed of his Croſs, his head begirt with a pillow of Thorns, his body drench'd in a bath of his own blood: to turn your backs upon this Bridegroom of Bloods, will certainly coſt you the blood of your ſouls, and therefore look to it.

Now when <hi>Herod</hi> had impriſoned <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſlain <hi>James</hi> with the ſword, he went down to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and there he made ſports and ſhows in honour of <hi>Ceſar;</hi> and <note place="margin">Pag. 510. 511.</note> on the ſecond day being moſt gorgeouſly apparelled, and the Sun ſhining very bright upon his Robe of Silver, his

Thus you ſee how dearly they have paid for it, that have not given Chriſt his due glory; and let theſe inſtances of his wrath alarm all your hearts ſo, that we may make more conſcience than ever, of ſetting the Crown of honour only upon Chriſt's head, <hi>for he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is worthy of all honour, glory and praiſe,</hi> Rev. 14. 10, 11.

            <p>Sixthly, Is Jeſus Chriſt God-man? is he very God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> very man? then from hence, as in a glaſs, you may ſee the true Reaſons why the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, though ſhort, very ſhort, yet have a ſufficient power and vertue in them to ſatisfie God's juſtice, to pacifie his wrath, to procure our pardon, and to ſave our immortal ſouls, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of the dignity of his perſon that died and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed for us; the ſon of God, yea, God himſelf: there was an infinite vertue and value in all his ſufferings, hence his <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 19.

To ſee one Sun clouded is much more than to ſee the Moon and all the Stars in Heaven overcaſt: Chriſt conſidered as God-man was great, very great; and the greater his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, the greater were his ſorrows, his ſufferings, his <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> humiliation, his compaſſion, his ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice; had not Chriſt been God-man, he could never have been an able ſurety, he could never have paid our <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> debts, he could never have ſatisfied divine Juſtice, he could never have brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> he could never have <hi>ſpoiled Principalities and Powers;</hi>

This is wiſely to be obſerved againſt the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66517:149"/> Papiſts, who make ſo great a noiſe of men's merits; for if Chriſt's ſufferings, as he was mere man, could not merit the leaſt favour from God, then what mortal man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to merit, at the hand of God, the leaſt of mercies by his greateſt ſufferings? But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Is Jeſus Chriſt God-man? is he very God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and very man? then, from hence we may ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pattern of humility and ſelf-denyal, that ever was, or will be in this world; that he who was the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he who was equal with God, that he ſhould <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6.

            <p>Tenthly, Is Jeſus Chriſt God-man, is he very God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> very man? then, from hence you may ſee the excellency of Chriſt above man, above all other men, yea, above <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in innocency.

A legal holineſs conſiſts in an exact, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and compleat conformity in heart and life, to the whole reveiled will of God; and this was the holineſs that <hi>Adam</hi> had in his innocency, and this holineſs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately derived from God, and was perfect: <hi>Adam</hi>'s holineſs was as co-natural to him, as unholineſs is now to us; <hi>Adam's</hi> holineſs was as natural, and as pleaſing, and as delightful to him, as any way of unholineſs can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, pleaſing, and delightful to us, The eſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency was an eſtate of perfect wiſdom, knowledg and underſtanding; witneſs the names that <hi>Adam</hi> gave to <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 20.</note> all the creatures, ſuitable and appoſite to their natures; The eſtate of innocency was an eſtate of great honour and dignity: <hi>David</hi> brings in <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocent eſtate with a Crown upon his head, and that Crown was a Crown of glory and honour; <hi>thou haſt crowned him with glory and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 5.</note> 
               <hi>honour,</hi> his place was <hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> but far above all other creatures, The eſtate of innocency, it was an eſtate of great Dominion and Authority, man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the Soveraign Lord of the whole Creation: <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 6, 7, 8.</note> we need not ſtand to enlarge upon one parcel of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſns; namely, that which they call Paradiſe, ſith the <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> whole both of Sea and Land, and all the creatures in both, were his Poſſeſſion, his Paradiſe: certainly man's firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was a ſtate of perfect and compleat happineſs; there being nothing within him, but what was deſirable; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him, but what was amiable; and nothing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66517:152"/> about him, but what was ſerviceable and comfortable: and yet Jeſus Chriſt, who is God-man, is infinitely more glorious and excellent than ever <hi>Adam</hi> was; for <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in a mutable condition, but Chriſt is the Rock of Ages, he is ſtedfaſt, and abiding for ever; <hi>he is yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and to day, and the ſame for ever;</hi> he is the ſame afore time, in time, and after time; he is the ſame, that is, unchangeable in his Eſſence, Promiſes, and Doctrine; Chriſt is the ſame in reſpect of vertue, and the faith of believers; even his Manhood, before it was in being, was cloathed with perfection of grace, and ſo continueth for ever. And again, <hi>Adam</hi> was a mere man, and alone by himſelf; but in Chriſt the humane nature was hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally united unto the divine; and hence it comes to paſs, that Chriſt, even as man, had a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and revelation of Grace, and heavenly gifts, than ever <hi>Adam</hi> had. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>in Chriſt dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bodily,</hi> that is eſſentially; that is, not by a naked and bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of vertue, as God is ſaid to dwell in his Saints; but by a ſubſtantial union of the two natures, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane, the eternal word and the man, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſoul and body, whereby they become one, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one perſon, one ſubſiſtence. Now from this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and wonderful union of the two natures in Chriſt, there flows to the Manhood of Chriſt a plenitude and fulneſs of all ſpiritual Wiſdom and Grace, ſuch as was never found in any mere man, no, not in <hi>Adam</hi> whileſt he ſtood in his integrity and uprightneſs. But,</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Is Jeſus Chriſt God man? is he very God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and very man? then this truth looks very ſowrly and frowningly upon all ſuch as deny the Godhead of Chriſt; as Arrians, Turks, Jews; how many be there in this City, in this Nation, who ſtiffly deny the Divinity of Chriſt, and diſpute againſt it, and write againſt it, and blaſpheme that great truth, without which, I think, a man may ſafely ſay, there is no poſſibility of ſalvation. In ancient times, near unto the Age of the Apoſtles, this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66517:153"/> Doctrine of Chriſt's Godhead, and Eternal Generation from the father, was greatly oppoſed by ſundry wicked and blaſphemous Hereticks, as <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Arrius, &amp;c,</hi> who ſtirred up great troubles, and bloody Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Church: for maintaining this great truth of Chriſt's Godhead, they aſſerted that Chriſt had no true ſleſh; 'twas only the likeneſs of fleſh which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in, and that his body was only a phantaſtick ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary body; but had the body of Chriſt been only ſuch a body; then his conception, nativity, death, reſurrection, are all too, but imaginary things; and then, his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and crucifiction are but mere fancies too; and if ſo, then what would become of us, what would become of our ſalvation; then our faith would be in vain, and our hope would be in vain, and our hearing, preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and receiving, would all be in vain; yea, then all our Religion would vaniſh into a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as this truth looks ſowerly upon the above mentioned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo it looks ſowerly upon the Papiſts; who, by their Doctrine of the real preſence of Chriſt's body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, do overthrow one of the properties of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, which is to be but in one place preſent at once.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66517:154"/> with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, I ſay, it was not the ſame, but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent: <note place="margin">Whether the work of man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption could have been wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Chriſt, is not determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by men; but that it was the moſt admirable way, which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, juſtice, and mercy, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, cannot be denied.</note> And the reaſon is, becauſe, though the enduring of the puniſhments, as to the ſubſtance of them, could, and did agree with him as a ſurety, yet the circumſtances of thoſe puniſhments could not have befallen him, unleſs he had been a ſinner; and therefore, every inordination in ſuffering was far from Chriſt, and a perpetual duration of ſuffering could not befall him; for the firſt of theſe had been contrary to the holineſs and dignity of his perſon, and the other had made void the end of his ſuretiſhip and Mediatorſhip; which was ſo to ſuffer, as yet to conquer, and to deliver, and therefore, though he did ſuffer death for us (in the ſubſtance of it) yet he neither did nor could ſuffer death in the circumſtances of it, ſo as for ever to be held by death; for then, in ſuffering death, he ſhould not have conquered death, nor delivered us from death; neither was it neceſſary to Chriſt's ſubſtitution, that he ſhould undergo, in every reſpect, the ſame puniſhment which the offender himſelf was liable unto: but if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent ſo much puniſhment as did ſatisfie the Law, and vindicate the Law-giver, in his holineſs, truth, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and righteouſneſs, that was enough. Now, that was unqueſtionably done by Chriſt, as the Scriptures do abundantly teſtifie. It muſt be readily granted, that Chriſt was to ſuffer the whole puniſhment due unto ſin, ſo far as it became the dignity of his perſon, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the work; but if he had ſuffered eternally, the work of Redemption could never have been accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and beſides, he ſhould have ſuffered that which could no ways beſeem him. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb. 2. 10. It became him to be conſecrated through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi> Chriſt was only to paſs through ſuch ſufferings as became him, who was ordained to be the Prince and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our ſalvation. It became him to be man, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him in our humane nature to ſuffer death, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to ſuſtain for us the ſubſtance of thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we ſhould have undergone; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he did: what our ſins did deſerve, and what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66517:155"/> might lay upon us for thoſe ſins, all that did Chriſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffer or bear: Jeſus Chriſt did ſo ſuffer for our ſins, as that his ſufferings were fully anſwerable to the demerit of our ſins. And I think I may ſafely ſay, that God, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, could not require any more, or lay on any one more puniſhment than Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer for our ſins: and my reaſon is this, becauſe Chriſt bare all our ſins and all our ſorrows, and was obedient unto the death, and made a <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. Gal. 3. 13.</note> curſe for us; and more than this, the Law of God could not require: and if Chriſt did ſuffer all that the Law of God required, then certainly he ſuffeed ſo much as did ſatisfie the juſtice of God: <hi>viz.</hi> as much puniſhment as was commenſurated with ſin. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, the meritorious cauſe, the main <note place="margin">7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 5. There were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubordinate ends of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; as, 1. To ſanctifie ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to us. 2. To ſweeten ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to us. 3. To ſuccour us expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally under all our ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18. 4. That he might be prepared to enter into his glory, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26 5. That he might be a Conquerour over ſufferings, which was one piece of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> end, and the ſpecial occaſion of all the ſufferings of Chriſt, were the ſins of his people: Chriſt was our ſurety, and he could not ſatisfie for our ſins, nor reconcile us to God without ſuffering, <hi>Iſa. 53. 5. But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions;</hi> the Hebrew word for wounded, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath a double Emphaſis; either it may ſignifie that he was pierced through as with a dart, or that he was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or pained, as women or other creatures are wont to be that bring forth with pain and torment, at the time of their travail: for the word in the Text laſt cited, comes regularly from a root that ſignifies properly to be in pain, as women are when they bring forth. It was our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that gave Chriſt his deadly wounds, it was our ſins that ſmote him, and bruiſed him. Look as <hi>Zippora</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod. 4. 25. Surely, a bloody husband art thou to me;</hi> ſo may Chriſt ſay to his Church, ſurely a bloody ſpouſe haſt thou been to me; Chriſt's ſpouſe may look upon him, and ſay, It was I that have been that <hi>Judas,</hi> that have betrayed thee, it was I that was the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that murdered thee, It was my ſins that brought all ſorrows and ſufferings, all miſchiefs and evils upon thee: I have ſinned, and thou haſt ſuffered: I have eaten the ſower Grapes, and thy teeth were ſet on edge: I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thou haſt died: I have wounded thee, and thou
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66517:155"/> haſt healed me. It is the wiſdom, and oh, that it might be more and more, the work of every believer, to look upon an humble Chriſt with an humble heart, a broken Chriſt with a broken heart, a bleeding Chriſt with a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, a wounded Chriſt with a wounded heart; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Chriſt was wounded, bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cut off for ſinners ſins. When Chriſt was taken by the ſouldiers, he ſaid, <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way:</hi> Chriſt was willing, that the hurt which ſinners had done to God, and the debt which they owed to him, ſhould be ſet upon his ſcore, and put upon his account: and the Apoſtle mentions it as a remarkable thing, <hi>That Chriſt died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. <hi>The juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. our ſins were the meritorious cauſe of Chriſt's ſufferings; Chriſt did not ſuffer for himſelf, <hi>for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15. cap. 7. 26.</note> 
               <hi>he was without ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> The grand deſign, errand and buſineſs about which Chriſt came into the world, was to ſave ſinners: He had his <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15. Mat. 1. 21.</note> name Jeſus, becauſe he was to ſave is people from their ſins: he died for our ſins; not only for our good, as the final cauſe; but for our ſins, as the procuring cauſe of his death. <hi>He was delivered for our offences, Chriſt died</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> The whole Teſtament hath not the like two relatives at once in the original, as if I ſhould ſay, by whoſe ſtripes of his, we are healed. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſtius)</hi> alludes to the ſtripes that ſervants receive from their cruel maſters: therefore he return to the ſecond perſon, <hi>ye are healed:</hi> here you ſee that the Phyſician's blood became the ſick man's ſalve, we can hardly believe the power of ſword-ſalve. But here is a myſtery, that only the Goſpel can aſſure us of, that the wounding of one ſhould be the cure of another: Oh, what an odious thing is ſin to God, that he will pardon none without blood, yea, without
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:66517:156"/> the blood of his deareſt ſon! Oh, what a Hell of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> muſt there be in ſin, that nothing can expiate it, but the beſt, the pureſt, the nobleſt blood that ever run in veins! Oh, what a tranſcendent evil muſt ſin be, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can purge it away but death, but the death of the Croſs, no death but an accurſed death! Oh, what a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie is ſin, that it muſt have blood, yea, the blood of God to take it away!</p>
            <p>Now, thus you have ſeen, 1. That the ſufferings of Chriſt have been free and voluntary, and not conſtrained or forced. 2. That they have been very great and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. 3. That the puniſhments which Chriſt did ſuffer for our ſins, were in their parts, and kinds, and degrees, and proportion, all thoſe puniſhments which were due unto us by reaſon of our ſins; and which we our ſelves ſhould otherwiſe have ſuffered. 4. That Jeſus Chriſt did feel and ſuffer the very torments of Hell, though not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a helliſh manner. 5. That he that did feel and ſuffer the torments of hell, though not after a holliſh manner, was God-man. 6. That the puniſhments that Chriſt did ſuſtain for us, muſt be referred only to the ſubſtance, and not to the circumſtances of puniſhment. 7. That the meritorious cauſe of all the ſufferings of Chriſt, were the ſins of his people. Now, to that great queſtion of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up your account at laſt, according to the import of <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 9. cap. 12. 14. Mat. 12. 14. cap. 18. 23.

               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:66517:156"/> And he hath reconciled both (Jews and Gentiles) unto God, in one body, on the Croſs; having ſlain enmity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: Jeſus Chriſt took upon him all my ſins; they were all of them laid upon him, and he bare or ſuffered all the wrath and puniſhment due for them, and he ſuffered all as my ſurety, in my ſtead, and for my good; and thou didſt deſign him for all this, and accepted of its ſufficient and effectual on my behalf. Oh, with what comfort, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and confidence, may a believer, upon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, hold up his head in the great day of his account.</p>
            <p>Let me now make a few inferences from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the great and grievous ſufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore!</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let us ſtand ſtill, and admire and wonder at the love of Jeſus Chriſt to poor ſinners; that Chriſt ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye for us, than the Angels; they were creatures of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more noble extract; and, in all probability, might have brought greater revenues of glory to God: yet, that Chriſt ſhould paſs by thoſe golden veſſels, and make us veſſels of glory, Oh, what amazing and aſtoniſhing love is this! <note place="margin">This is the envy of Devils, and the admiration of Angels and Saints.</note> The Angels were more honourable and excellent creatures than we; they were celeſtial ſpirits, we earthly bodies, duſt and aſhes; they were immediate attendants upon God, they were, as I may ſay, of his privy chamber; we ſervants of his in the lower houſe of this world, farther remote from his glorious preſence; their office was to ſing Hallelujahs, Songs of praiſe to God in the heavenly Paradiſe, ours to dreſs the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was but an earthly Paradiſe; they ſinned but once, and but in thought (as is commonly thought,) but <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned in thought, by luſting, in deed, by taſting, and in word, by excuſing: why did not Chriſt ſuffer for their ſins, as well as for ours? or if for any, why not for theirs rather than ours? <hi>Even ſo, O Father, for ſo it pleaſed thee.</hi> We move this queſtion, not as being curious to ſearch thy ſecret counſels, O Lord, but that we may be the more ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 26.</note> up in the admiration of the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, of the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66517:157"/> knowledg. The Apoſtle, being in a holy admiration of <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 18. 19.</note> Chriſt's love, affirms it to paſs knowledg; that God, who is the eternal Being, ſhould love man when he had ſcarce <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 30, 31.</note> a Being, that he ſhould be enamoured with deformity, that he ſhould love us when in our blood, that he ſhould pity us when no eye pitied us, no, not our own: Oh, ſuch was Chriſt's tranſcendent love, that man's extreme <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> miſery could not abate it; the deploredneſs of man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition did but heighten the holy flame of Chriſt's love; 'tis as high as Heaven, who can reach it? 'tis as low as Hell, who can underſtand it? Heaven (through its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) could not contain him (man being miſerable) nor Hell's torments make him refrain, ſuch was his perfect matchleſs love to fallen man: that Chriſt's love ſhould extend to the ungodly, to ſinners, to enemies that were in arms of rebellion againſt him; yea, not only ſo, but <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6, 8, 10.</note> that he ſhould hug them in his arms lodg them in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, dandle them upon his knees, and lie them to his breaſts, that they may ſuck and be ſatisfied, is the higheſt improvement of love. That Chriſt ſhould come from the <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 11, 12, 13.</note> eternal boſom of his father, to a Region of ſorrow and <note place="margin">John 1. 18. Iſa. 53. 4. 1 Tim. 3. 16.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66517:157"/> other things ſpeak out the tranſcendent love of Jeſus Chriſt to poor ſinners: That wrath, that great wrath, that fierce wrath, that pure wrath, that infinite wrath, that matchleſs wrath of an angry God, that was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly impreſt upon the Soul of Chriſt, quickly ſpent his natural ſtrength, and turned his moiſture into the <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 4.</note> drought of ſummer; and yet all this wrath he patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underwent, that Sinners might be ſaved, and <hi>that he</hi>

Chriſt's love is like his name, and that is wonderful, yea it is ſo wonderful, that <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:66517:158"/> it is <hi>ſupra omnem creaturam, ultra omnem menſuram, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra omnem naturam, above all creatures, beyond allmeaſure, contrary to all nature.</hi> 'Tis above all Creatures, for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels, and therefore above all others: 'Tis beyond all Meaſure, for time did not begin it, and time ſhall never end it; place doth not bound it, ſin doth not exceed it, no eſtate, no age, no ſex is denied it, tongues cannot expreſs it, underſtandings cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: and 'tis contrary to all Nature; for what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can love where it is hated? what nature can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, where it is provoked? what nature can offer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement where it receiveth wrong? what nature can heap up kindneſs upon contempt, favour upon ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, mercy upon ſin? and yet Chriſt's love hath led him to all this; ſo that wel may we ſpend all our days in admiring and adoring of this wonderful love, and be always raviſhed with the thoughts of it.

That bleſſed Virgin in <hi>Baſil,</hi> being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Chriſtianity to the fire, and having her eſtate and life offered her if ſhe would worſhip Idols, cried out, Let money periſh, and life vaniſh, Chriſt is better than all.

Thus you ſee with what a ſuperlative love, with what an over-topping love, former Saints have loved our Lord Jeſus; and can you Chriſtians, who are cold and low in your love to Chriſt, read over theſe inſtances, and not bluſh? Certainly the more Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, the more dear Chriſt ſhould be unto us; the more bitter his ſufferings have been for us, the more
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66517:159"/> ſweet his love ſhould be to us, and the more eminent ſhould be our love to him: O let a ſuffering Chriſt lie neareſt your hearts; let him be your Manna, your Tree of Life, your Morning-ſtar: 'tis better to part with all than with this Pearl of price. Chriſt is that golden pipe through which the golden oyl of ſalvation runs; and oh how ſhould this inflame our love to Chriſt! Oh that our hearts were more affected with the ſufferings of Chriſt! Who can tread upon theſe hot coals, and his <note place="margin">Can. 8. 7, 8.</note> heart not burn in love to Chriſt, and cry out with <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> Chriſt my love is crucified?

Shall our ſins be grievous unto Chriſt, and ſhall they not be odious unto us? ſhall he die for our ſins, and ſhall not we die to our ſins? did not he therefore ſuffer for ſin, that we might ceaſe from ſin? did not he <hi>bear our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi>

It was neither <hi>Judas,</hi> nor <hi>Pilate,</hi> nor the Jews, nor the Souldiers, that could have done our Lord Jeſus the leaſt hurt, had not our ſins, like ſo many Butchers and Hangmen, come in to their aſſiſtance. After <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was treacherouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Senate-houſe, <hi>Antonius</hi> brought forth his Coat, all bloody, cut and mangled, and laying it open to the view of the people, ſaid, Look, here is your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors coat, and as the bloody conſpirators have dealt by it, ſo have they dealt with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the people were all in an uproar, and nothing would ſatisfie them but the death of the murtherers, and they run to the houſes of the conſpirators, and burnt them down to the ground: But what was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s coat, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s body, to the body of our dear Lord Jeſus, which was all bloody, rent and torn for our ſins? Ah, how ſhould this provoke us to be revenged on our ſins! how ſhould we for ever loath and abhorr them! how ſhould our fury be whetted againſt them! how ſhould we labour with all our might to be the death of thoſe ſins, that have been the death of ſo great a Lord, and will, if not prevented, be the death of our Souls to all eternity. To ſee God thruſt the ſword of his pure, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and incenſed wrath, through the very heart of his deareſt Son, notwithſtanding all his ſupplications, prayers, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> tears and ſtrong cries, is the higheſt diſcovery of the Lords hatred and indignation of ſin that ever was or will be: 'Tis true God diſcovered his great hatred againſt ſin, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, and by caſting the Angels down to hell, by drowning the old world, and by rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hell out of heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and

'Tis true, God diſcovers his hatred of ſin, by thoſe endleſs, eaſleſs and remedileſs torments that he inflicts upon Devils and damned ſpirits; but this is no hatred, to that hatred againſt ſin, which God diſcovered when he opened all the flood-gates of his envenom'd wrath upon his Son, his own Son, his only Son, his Son <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 6.

And this muſt be our great Plea, our choice, our ſweet, our ſafe, our comfortable, our acceptable Plea, both in the day of our particular accounts when we die, and in the great day of our account, when a crucified Saviour ſhall judge the World. Although ſin, as an act, be tranſient, yet in the guilt of it, it lies in the Lord's high Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, filed upon record againſt the ſinner, and calling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for deſerved puniſhment, ſaying, Man hath ſinned and man muſt ſuffer for ſin: but now Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that plea is taken off. Lo here, ſaith the Lord the ſame Nature that ſinned, ſuffereth; mine own Son,, being made fleſh, hath ſuffered death for ſin in the fleſh; the thing is done, the Law is ſatisfied, and ſo non-ſuits the action, and caſts it out of the Court, as unjuſt. Thus whereas ſin would have condemned us, Chriſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin; he hath weakned, yea nullified and taken away ſin, in the guilt and condemning power of it, by that abundant ſatisfaction that he hath given to the Juſtice of God by his active and paſſive Obedience: ſo that <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> for <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1, 3.</note> the blood of the Mediator out-cries the clamour of ſin: and this muſt be a Chriſtians joy, and triumph, and plea in the great day of our Lord Jeſus.

This is to be juſtified, to have the ſin pardoned, and the penalty remitted; <hi>Rom. 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.

            <p>Thus you ſee that Juſtification, for the nature of it, lies in the gracious pardon of the ſinners tranſgreſſions, and in the acceptation of his perſon as righteous in Gods ſight. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, In order to the partaking of this grace of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> forgiveneſs of our ſins, and the acceptation of our perſons, we muſt be able to produce a perfect righteouſneſs before the Lord, and to preſent it and tender it unto him; and the reaſon is evident from the very nature of God, who is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> Habak. 1. 13, that is, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Habak. 1. 13. Heb.</hi> And to look on i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity thou canſt not do it.</note> with patience or pleaſure, or without puniſhing it. There are four things that God cannot do: 1. He cannot lie: 2. He cannot die: 3. He cannot deny himſelf: 4. He cannot behold iniquity with approbation and delight: <hi>Joſh. 24. 19. And Joſhua ſaid unto the people, ye cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your tranſgreſſions, nor your ſins:</hi> ſuch is the holineſs of God's nature, that he cannot behold ſin, <note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 4, 5, 6.</note> that he cannot but puniſh ſin where ever he finds it: God is infinitely, immutably, and inexorably juſt, as well as he is incomprehenſibly gracious. Now, in the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner, God doth act as a God of juſtice, as well as a God of compaſſion: God is infinite in all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in his juſtice as well as in his mercy: theſe two cannot interfere; as juſtice cannot intrench upon mercy, ſo neither may mercy encroach upon juſtice; the glory of both muſt be maintained. Now, by the breach of the Law, the juſtice of God is wronged; ſo that, although mercy be apt to pardon, yet juſtice requires ſatisfaction, and calls for vengeance on ſinners. Every tranſgreſſion <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2.</note> muſt receive juſt recompence, and God will not, in any caſe, abſolve the guilty: till this be done, the hands of <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note> mercy are tied, that ſhe cannot act. And ſeeing ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could not be made to an infinite majeſty, but by an
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66517:174"/> equal perſon, and price; therefore the ſon of God muſt become a curſe for us, by taking our nature, and pouring out his ſoul to the death; and by this means juſtice and mercy are reconciled, and kiſs each other, and mercy now being ſet at liberty, hath her free courſe, to ſave poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. God will have his juſtice ſatisfied to the full, and therefore Chriſt muſt bear all the puniſhment due to our ſins, or elſe God cannot ſet us free, for he cannot go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own juſt will: obſerve the force of that phraſe, <hi>Chriſt ought to ſuffer, And thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> and <hi>Mat. 26. 54. Thus it muſt be,</hi> why muſt? but becauſe it was, 1. So decreed by God: 2. Foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, every particular of Chriſt's ſufferings were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the prophets, even to their very ſpitting in his face. 3. Prefigured in the daily morning and evening ſacrifice; this Lamb of God was ſacrificed from the beginning of the world.

An earthly Prince that is juſt, holds himſelf bound, to inflict puniſhment impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, upon the malefactor, or his ſurety; it ſtands upon his honour, he ſaith it muſt be ſo, I cannot do otherwiſe: this is true much more of God, who is Juſtice it ſelf, God, who is great in counſel, and excellent in working; had ſtore of means at hand, whereby to ſet free, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover loſt man-kind; yet he was pleaſed, in his infinite wiſdom, to pitch upon this way of ſatisfaction, as being moſt agreeable to his holy nature, and moſt ſuitable to his high and ſovereign ends; <hi>viz.</hi> Man's ſalvation and his own glory: and that God doth ſtand upon full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and will not forgive one ſin without it, may be thus made evident.</p>

He is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs;</hi> he doth not ſay he is merciful, but <hi>juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> becauſe they are ſatisfied for, and God's juſtice will not let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſame debt twice, of the ſurety and of the debtor too: it will never ſtand with the unſpotted juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, to require ſuch debts of us; which Chriſt, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> by ſhedding his moſt precious blood, hath diſcharged for us. Mark, the maledictory ſentence of death, denounced by the Law againſt ſinners, was inflicted by God upon Chriſt: this is that which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> poſitively aſſerts; where he ſaith, <hi>the chaſtiſement</hi> (that is, the puniſhment called a chaſtiſement, becauſe inflicted by a father, and only for a <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 7.</note> time) <hi>of ourpeace was upon him;</hi> and again, <hi>he was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted:</hi> which, according to the genuine ſence of the Original, is better rendred, it was exacted; to wit, the puniſhment of our ſin, and he was afflicted, or he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, to the demand of the penalty. The curſe, to <note place="margin">Theod. diſp. l. 15. c. 5.</note> which we are ſubject (ſaith <hi>Theodorus)</hi> he aſſumed upon himſelf of his own accord; the death that was not due <note place="margin">Gr. mer. l. 3. c. 13.</note> to him he underwent, that we might not undergo that death which was due to us: ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi> he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">Arnol. de ſep. verb Tr. 1.</note> a debter for us, who were debtors; and therefore the Creditor exacts it from him, ſaith <hi>Arnoldus.</hi> Now, God's juſtice being ſatisfied for our offences, it cannot but remit
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66517:176"/> thoſe offences to us: As the Creditor cannot demand that of the debtor, which the ſurety hath already paid; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can God exact the puniſhment of us, which Chriſt hath ſuffered; and therefore, <hi>it is juſt with God, to forgive us our ſins.</hi> It will be altogether needleſs to enquire, whether it had been injuſtice in God, to forgive without ſatisfaction: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s determination is very ſolid, there <note place="margin">Aug. de Trinit. l. 13. c. 10.</note> wanted not to God another poſſible way (and if it were unjuſt, it were impoſſible) but this of ſatisfaction was moſt agreeable to divine wiſdom; before God did decree this way, it might be free to have uſed it or not; but in decreeing, this ſeemed moſt convenient, and after it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">When you are forgiven, you are then releaſed, and for ever acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reckonings with the juſtice of God; divine Juſtice hath no more to ſay or do againſt you, for <hi>remiſſa culpa, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the debt being paid by Chriſt, God's very juſtice (as I may ſay with reverence) would trouble him, if he ſhould not give in the bond, and give out an acquittance. The believing peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner may, in an humble confidence, ſue out his pardon, not only at the throne of grace, but at the bar of juſtice, in theſe or the like expreſſions; Lord, thou haſt puniſhed my ſins in thy ſon, wilt thou puniſh them in me? thou haſt accepted that ſuffering of thy ſon, as the puniſhment of my ſin, therefore thou canſt not, in juſtice, exact it of me, for this were to puniſh twice for one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which thy juſtice cannot but abhor. Oh ſirs, God doth not pronounce men righteous when they are not; but firſt he makes them ſo, and then he pronounces them to be ſuch: ſo that if a man will be juſtified, he muſt be able to produce ſuch a compleat righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he may ſtand before the juſtice of God: ah ſinners! the Lord is infinitely juſt, as well as merciful; and if ever your ſins be pardoned, it muſt be by an admirable contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, or mixture of mercy and juſtice together: it was one of the great ends of the Goſpel-diſpenſation, that God might exalt his juſtice in the juſtification of a ſinner, <hi>Rom. 3. 26.

All believers have a righteouſneſs in Chriſt as full and complete, as if they had fulfilled the Law, Chriſt being the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to believers, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3, 4.</note> inveſts believers with a righteouſneſs every way as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, as the perſonal obedience of the Law would have
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66517:177"/> inveſted them withal. When men had violated God's holy Law, God in juſtice reſolved that his Law ſhould be ſatisfied before man ſhould be ſaved: now this was done by Chriſt, who was the end of the Law; he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it actively and paſſively, and ſo the injury offered to the Law is recompenced. God had rather that all men ſhould be deſtroyed, than that his Law ſhould not be ſatisfied. No man can perfectly be juſtified in the ſight of God without a perfect righteouſneſs, every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable to God's holy Law, which is the Rule of righteouſneſs; <hi>Do this and live:</hi> neither can any perſon have any choice, ſpiritual, lively communion with a righteous God, till he be clothed with the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. All Chriſt's active and paſſive obedience was either for himſelf or in our ſtead and behalf; but it was not for himſelf, but for us that he ſuffered and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed: whatſoever Chriſt did or ſuffered in the whole courſe of his life, he did it; and ſuffered it as our Surety, and in our ſteads: for as God would not diſpenſe with the penalty of the Law without ſatisfaction, ſo he would not diſpenſe with the commands of the Law without perfect obedience. Remember once for all, that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſufferings of Chriſt make but up one entire and perfect obedience to the whole Law; nor had Chriſt been a perfect and complete Saviour, if he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what the Law required, as well as ſuffered the penalty which the Law inflicted. The imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us is a gracious Act of God the Father, according to his good will and pleaſure, whereby as a Judge he accounts believers ſins unto the Surety, as if he had committed the ſame; and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt unto the believer, as if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ſame, the ſame obedience that Chriſt did in his own perſon: ſo that Chriſt's imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is as effectual to the full, for the acceptance of the believing ſinner, as if he had yielded ſuch obedience to the Lord himſelf: hence his righteouſneſs is called <hi>our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. now without this righteouſneſs

When a Law is ſolemnly enacted, with a penalty in caſe of tranſgreſſion, all thoſe whom it concerns may conclude for certain, that the Law-giver will proceed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and it is a Rule in Policy, That Laws once eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and publiſhed, ſhould be vigorouſly preſerved: If the Lord ſhould have wholly wav'd the execution of the Law upon ſinners, or their ſurety, it might have tended greatly to the weakning of its authority, and the diminiſhing of the reverence of his ſovereignty in the hearts of the ſons of men: How often does. God uſe that Oath, <hi>As I live,</hi> for the fulfilling of his threatnings as well as of his <note place="margin">Jer. 22. 24. Ezek. 5. 9, 10, 11.</note> promiſes: the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> is as true, faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his threatnings as in his promiſes; what he hath threatned ſhall undoubtedly come to paſs; he will be made known by his Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the full executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his threatnings: The old World found it ſo, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> found it ſo; yea the whole Nation of the Jews have found it ſo to this very day. Look as all the ſaints <note place="margin">See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 13, 15.</note> in heaven will readily put to their Seals, that God is true and faithful in all his Promiſes; ſo all the damned in hell will readily put to their Seals, that God is faithful in all his threatnings. Men frequently deride the Laws, and threatnings of great men, when they are not put into execution; it is the execution of Laws, that is the very life and ſoul of good Laws. Should God pardon ſin, without exacting the penalty of the Law, how <note place="margin">

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66517:178"/> But now when God lets ſinners ſee, that he will not pardon ſin, without exacting the penalty of the Law, either of the ſinner, or of his Surety; then the ſinner cries out, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
               <hi>and knowledge of God!</hi> God ſtood ſo much upon the complete ſatisfaction and accompliſhment of his Law, that he was willing that Chriſt ſhould be a ſacrifice, that the Law might be ſatisfied in its penalty, and that Chriſt <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3, 4, 5.</note> in his own perſon ſhould fulfil the righteouſneſs of the Law, that it might be ſatisfied in its commands: now in this plenary ſatisfaction made to the Law, the Wiſdom of God does gloriouſly ſhine. The heart of God was ſo ſet upon a full ſatisfaction to his Law, that, rather than it ſhould not be done, his own Son muſt come from heaven and put on fleſh, and be himſelf made under the <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> Law; he muſt live a holy life, and die a curſed death, and all to ſatisfie the Law, and to keep up the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly; God doth ſtand upon full ſatisfaction, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will not forgive one ſin without it, that he might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off all occaſions, which the Devil, his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemy, might take to calumniate and traduce him: for if God did not ſtand upon full ſatisfaction, the Devil might accuſe him 1. of Inconſtancy and Changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that having threatned death to tranſgreſſors, he did quite forget himſelf, in waving the threatning, and diſpenſing wholly with his Law, by granting them free remiſſion: Yea, 2. of Partiality and reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he ſhould be ſo eaſie and forbearing; as to let them paſs without any puniſhment at all; having been formerly ſo ſevere and rigid againſt himſelf in caſting him and his Angels down to hell, and keeping them in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting flames and chains of darkneſs, without the leaſt <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.

Satan might ſay, Lord, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have ſpared me as well as Man: but the Lord can now anſwer, Man hath made ſatisfaction, he hath born the Curſe, and thereby fully diſcharged all the demands of the Law; if he had not, I would no more have ſpared

But</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, God's ſtanding upon full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and his not forgiving one ſin without it, bears a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible character of his goodneſs and loving kindneſs, as well as it ſounds out aloud the glory of divine Juſtice. The great and the holy God whoſe Name is holy, <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 1, 11.</note> might have rigorouſly exacted the penalty of the Law on the perſons of ſinners themſelves; but he hath ſo far diſpenſed with his own Law, as to admit of a Surety, by whom the end of the Law, that is, the manifeſtation of his Juſtice and hatred of ſin might be fulfilled, and yet a conſiderable part of Mankind might be preſerved from the jaws of the ſecond death, <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note> which otherwiſe muſt unavoidably have periſhed to all eternity. God ſeems to ſpeak at ſuch a rate as this; I may not, I will not ſuffer this high affront of <hi>Adam</hi>

There is none of us that have ſuch an inherent righteouſneſs in our ſelves that we dare plead before the Bar of God: and though God hath provided ſuch a glorious Robe of righteouſneſs for poor ſinners, as is the wonder and amazement of Angels, yet what would all this avail the poor ſinner, if this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be not made over to him? O ſirs! remember this, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs muſt be yours, it muſt be made over to you, or elſe it will never ſtand you in ſtead, <hi>Rom. 5. 17. For if by one mans offence, death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in glory by one Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> except they receive the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it is nothing to them: Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in it ſelf white rayment and beautiful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparrel, but it will never cover our nakedneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be put on, and we are cloathed with it; it muſt be made over to us, or we can never be juſtified by it, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. He of God is made to us righteouſneſs;</hi> if he be not made to us righteouſneſs, we ſhall never be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: Though man hath loſt a righteouſneſs to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by, yet there is an abſolute neceſſity of having one; God cannot love nor delight in any thing but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: God is a holy God, a righteous God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can only love and take pleaſure in thoſe that are righteous, both by a righteouſneſs imputed and a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imparted, <hi>Iſa. 45. 24. Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified and ſhall glory:</hi> Iſa. 54. 17. <hi>Their righteouſneſs is of me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> Pſal. 71. 16. <hi>I will make mention of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even of thine only.</hi> Look as no man can be made
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66517:179"/> rich by another mans riches, except they are made his; ſo no man can be made righteous by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, except his righteouſneſs be made over to him: hence he is called, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> Jer. 23. 6. and hence we are ſaid to be <hi>the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. hence we are ſaid <hi>by his obedience to be made righteous,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, The way whereby this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Cods providing is conveyed and made over to us, that we may receive the benefit thereof, and be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, it is by way of Imputation; the meaning is this, God doth reckon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto his people, as if it were their own; he doth count unto them Chriſt's ſufferings and ſatisfaction, and makes them partakers of the vertue thereof, as if themſelves had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and ſatisfied: This is the genuine and proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the word Imputation; when that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally done by one, is accounted and reckoned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and laid upon his ſcore, as if he had done it. Thus it is in this very caſe: we ſinned and fell ſhort of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom. 3. 21. Iſa.</hi> 53. Imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſeems to be prefigured by the skins wherewith the Lord after the fall cloathed our firſt parents; the bodies of the beaſts were for ſacrifice, and the skins to put them in mind, that their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was like the ſig-leaves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and that therefore they muſt be juſtified another way.</note> the glory of God, and became obnoxious to the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Juſtice of God; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his obedience and death hath given full content and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to divine Juſtice on our behalf: now when God doth pardon and accept us hereupon, he doth put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our account, he doth reckon or impute it unto us as fully, in reſpect of the benefit thereof, as if we our ſelves had performed it in our own perſons: and this is the way wherein the holy Ghoſt frequently expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom. 4. 6. Even as David alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works;</hi> and <hi>ver. 11. That righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo:</hi> and therefore it highly concerns us to mind this Scripture-rule, That in order to the ſatisfaction of the Juſtice of God, the ſins of Gods people were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reckoned unto Chriſt, and in order to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the benefit of that ſatisfaction, or deliverance thereby, Chriſt's righteouſneſs muſt be imputed and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66517:180"/> reckoned unto us. The firſt branch of this Rule you have, <hi>Iſa. 53. 5, 6. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> And for the other branch of the Rule, ſee <hi>Rom. 5. 19. As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> ver. 17. <hi>As by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From the compariſon between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is evident, that as <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, is imputed to all his poſterity, and that in reſpect thereof they are reputed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and accurſed, and liable to eternal death; ſo alſo Chriſt's obedience, whereby he fulfilled the Law, is ſo imputed to the members of his myſtical body, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God, they ſtand as innocent, juſtified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to eternal life. Look as <hi>Adam</hi> was the common root of all Mankind, and ſo his ſin is imputed to all his poſterity; ſo Jeſus Chriſt is the common root of all the faithful, and his obedience is imputed to them all: for it were ridiculous to ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin had more power to condemn, than Chriſt's righteouſneſs hath to ſave: and who but fools <hi>in folio</hi> will ſay that God doth not impute Chriſt's righteouſneſs as well as <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin? The Apoſtle's parallel between the two <hi>Adams</hi> does clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, That as the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imputed to us, inſomuch that in his ſinning we all ſinned; ſo the obedience of Chriſt is as really imputed unto us, inſomuch that in his obeying, reputatively and legally we obey alſo. How did <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin become ours? Why, by way of imputation, he tranſgreſſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 6, 11, 12. As imitation of <hi>Adam</hi> only made us not ſinners, ſo imitation of Chriſt only makes us not righteous, but the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Dew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the Covenant
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66517:180" rendition="simple:additions"/> of works and the tranſactions thereof, <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the ſtead, and acted in the behalf not only of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but of all his poſterity, and therefore his ſin is reckoned unto them; even ſo, ſaith the Apoſtle, after the ſame manner, the obedience and righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made over to many for Juſtification. I cannot underſtand the analogy betwixt the two <hi>Adams</hi> (wherein the Apoſtle is ſo clear and full) unleſs this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as here ſtated, be granted. Look as Chriſt was made ſin for us only by imputation, ſo we are made righteous only by the imputation of his righteouſneſs to us, as the Scripture every where evidences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <note place="margin">1 P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now our ſin was imputed to Chriſt, not only in the bitter effects of it, but he took the guilt of them upon himſelf (as I have in this Treatiſe already evidenced:) ſo then his righteouſneſs or active obedience it ſelf muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably imputed to us, and not only in the effects thereof. The Mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt can no way become the believers, but as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience became his poſterities (who never had the leaſt actual ſhare in his tranſgreſſion) that is by an act of imputation from God as a Judge, the Lord Jeſus having fulfilled the Law as a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> God the Father imputeth it to the believing ſoul, as if he had done it in his own perſon. I do not ſay that God the Father doth account the ſinner to have done it; but I ſay that God the Father doth impute it to the believing ſinner, as if he had done it, unto all ſaving intents and purpoſes. Hence Chriſt is called <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. (An awakened ſoul, that is truly ſenſible of his own baſeneſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

Chriſt Jeſus is made unto us of God wiſdom, righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And pray how is Chriſt made righteouſneſs to the believer? not by infuſion, but impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; not by putting righteouſneſs into him, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a righteouſneſs upon him, even his own righteouſneſs, by the imputing his merits, his ſatisfaction, his obedience unto them, through which they are accepted as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. Chriſt's righteouſneſs is his in reſpect of inheſion, but it is ours in reſpect of imputation; his righteouſneſs is his perſonally, but ours meritoriouſly: we are juſtified by anothers righteouſneſs, and that only, and therefore by imputed righteouſneſs, for anothers righteouſneſs can no other way be made ours but only by imputation, <hi>Rom. 5. 18. By the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men to juſtification:</hi> were it any other than imputed righteouſneſs, it would be as manifold a righteouſneſs as there are perſons juſtified; but it is ſaid to be <hi>the righteouſneſs of one that comes upon all men for juſtification of life.</hi> That is a choice word that you have in <hi>Rev. 19. 8.

Now in ſuch debt-books, Merchants uſe to ſet down, whatever payments are only made, either by the debtors themſelves, or by others in the behalf of them; an example whereof we have in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon, verſ.</hi> 18. where <hi>Paul</hi> undertakes to <hi>Philemon,</hi> for <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; if he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that on my account:</hi> that is, account <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his debt, to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſatisfaction or payment to <hi>Oneſimus</hi> which anſwers the double imputation, in point of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 1, 2.</note> that is, of our ſins to Chriſt, and of Chriſt's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to us; both which are implyed, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21.

The language of Jeſus Chriſt to his father, ſeems
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66517:183"/> to be this; Oh holy Father, I have freely and willingly taken all the debts, and all the ſins of all the believers in the world upon me; I have undertaken to be their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, to ſatisfie thy juſtice, to pacifie thy wrath, to fulfil thy Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore, Loe, here I am ready <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 6, 7, 8. Heb. 10. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> to do what ever thou commandeſt, and ready to ſuffer whatſoever thou pleaſeſt, I am willing to be reckoned a ſinner, that they may be reckoned righteous; I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be accounted curſed, that they may be for ever bleſſed; I am willing to pay all their debts that they may be ſet at liberty; I am willing to lay down my life, that <note place="margin">John 10. 11, 15, 17, 18.

Oh, what wonderful wiſdom, grace and love is here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted! that when we were neither able to ſatisfie the penalty of the Law, or to bring a conformity to it; that then Chriſt ſhould interpoſe, and become both redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and righteouſneſs for us.</p>
            <p>Now, from the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may form up this fifth plea, as to all the ten Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh, bleſſed God, thou haſt given me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt includes, firſt, the habitual holineſs of his perſon, in the abſenſe of all ſin, and in the rich and plentiful preſence of all holy and requiſite qualities: Secondly, the actual holineſs of his life and death by obedience. By his active obedience he perfectly fulfilled the commands of the Law; and by his paſſive obedience, his voluntary ſufferings, he ſatisfied the penalty and commination of the Law for tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: That perfect ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it requires; either in way of puniſhing for ſin, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the law, made by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, the Mediator of the new Covenant, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head, repreſenting all thoſe, whom the father hath given to him, and made over unto them that believe in him. This is that righteouſneſs that is imputed to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66517:183"/> in their Juſtification, and this imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy dear ſon, and my dear ſaviour, is now my plea, before thy bar of Juſtice. Imputed righteouſneſs is the ſame materially with that which the Law requireth; <note place="margin">The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Law requireth, upon pain of damnation, is a perfect obedience &amp; conformity to the whole Law of God, performed by every ſon and daughter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his own perſon. Now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſame materially with that which the Law requireth.</note> it is obedience to the Law of God exactly, and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed to the very utmoſt <hi>Iota</hi> and tittle thereof, without the leaſt abatement, Chriſt hath paid the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing. He is the fulfilling of the Law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and he hath fulfilled the Law in the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the intent, that it might be fulfilled in the ſame nature, to which it was at firſt given; and all this he hath expreſly done in all their names, and on all their behalfs, that believe in him; <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in them,</hi> Rom. 8. 3, 4. It is as if our dear Lord Jeſus had ſaid, oh bleſſed father, this I ſuffer, and this I do to the uſe, and in the ſtead, and room of all thoſe that have ventured their ſouls upon me, that they may have a righteouſneſs, which they may truly call their own, and on which they may ſafely reſt, and in which they may for ever glory; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 24, 25. Now, it will never ſtand with the unſpotted holineſs, juſtice and righteouſneſs of God, to reject this righteouſneſs of his ſon, or that plea that is bottomed upon it.

            <p>Secondly, Know for your comfort, that, this imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this mediatory Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, takes away all your unrighteouſneſs, it cancels every bond, it takes <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 6, 7. Coloſ. 2. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> away all iniquity, and anſwers for all your ſins. Lord, here are my ſins of omiſſion, and here are my ſins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, hath anſwered for them all: here are my ſins againſt the Law, and here are my ſins againſt the Goſpel, and here are my ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the offers of grace, the tenders of grace, the ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace, the bowels of grace; but the Rightcouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt hath anſwered for them all. I have read, that, when a Cordial was offered to a godly man that was ſick; Oh (ſaid he) the cordial of cordials which I daily take, is, that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all our ſins. Oh ſirs. it would be high blaſphemy, for any to <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7.</note> imagine, that there ſhould be more demerit in any ſin, yea, in all ſin, to condemn a believer, than there is merit in <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1, 33, 34, 35.</note> Chriſt's righteouſneſs, to abſolve him, to juſtifie him. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt, was ſhadowed out by the glorious Robes, and apparrel of the High Prieſt: That <note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> attire, in which the High Prieſt appeared before God, what was it elſe, but a type of Chriſt's righteouſneſs? The filthy garments of <hi>Joſhua</hi> (who repreſented the Church) were not only taken off from him, thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the removal of our ſins; but alſo a new fair gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Zach. 3. 4, 5.</note> was put upon him, to ſignifie our being clothed with the wedding garment of Chriſt's righteouſneſs. If any ſhall ſay, how is it poſſible, that a ſoul that is defiled with the worſt of ſins, ſhould be whiter than the ſnow yea, <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 7.</note> beautiful and glorious in the cyes of God; the anſwer is

But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Know for your comfort, that this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, preſents us perfectly righteous in the ſight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of God; <hi>He is made to us righteouſneſs.</hi> The Robe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> like the veil of the Temple is rent aſunder: our righteouſneſs is a ragged righteouſneſs, our righteouſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">Iſa. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That is, through Chriſt, we are as righteous, as if we <note place="margin">Finis perſiciens nen interſic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The end of the Law, is to juſtifie and ſave thoſe which fulfil it; Chriſt ſubjected himſelf thereto, he perfectly fulfilled it for us, and his perfect righteouſneſs is imputed to us; Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the moral Law, not for himſelf, but for us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt doing it for believers, they fulfil the Law in Chriſt; and ſo Chriſt by doing, and they believing in him that doth it, do fulfil the Law: or Chriſt may be faid to be the end of the Law, becauſe the end of the Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs, that a man may be juſtified thereby, which end we cannot attain of our ſelves, through the frailty of our fleſh, but by Chriſt we attain it, who hath fulfilled the Law for us. Chriſt hath perfectly fulfilled the Decalogue for us, and that 3 ways: 1. In his pure conception: 2. In his godly life: 3. in his holy and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſufferings and all for us: for whatſoever the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that we ſhould be, do or ſuffer, he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our behalf. Therefore one wittily ſaith, that Chriſt <note place="margin">Arctius.</note> is <hi>Telos, the end</hi> or <hi>tribute;</hi> and we by his payment, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teleis, Tribute free;</hi> we are diſcharged by him, before God. Chriſt, in reſpect of the integrity and purity of his nature, being conceived without ſin; and in reſpect of his life and <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 18. Luk. 1. 35. 2 Cor. 5. 21.

The infinite wiſdom and power of dear Jeſus in reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law and the Goſpel, in this great myſtery of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is greatly to be magnified. In the bleſſed Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66517:186"/> we find the righteouſneſs of Juſtification, to take its various denominations: In reſpect of the material cauſe, it is called the righteouſneſs of the Law: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the efficient cauſe, it is called the righteouſneſs of <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 30.

The Law, as it was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, required exact and perfect obedience, in men's proper perſons; this was legal Juſtification. But in the new Covenant, God is contented to accept this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the hand of a ſurety, and this is Evangelical Juſtification; this righteouſneſs preſents us in the ſight of God, as <hi>all fair;</hi> Cant. 4. 7. as <hi>complete;</hi> Coloſ. 2. 10. as <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle;</hi> Eph. 5. 27. as <hi>without fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of God;</hi> Rev. 14. 5. as <hi>holy, and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unreproveable in his ſight;</hi> Coloſ. 1. 22.

            <p>Fourthly, know for your comfort, that this imputed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> righteouſneſs of Chriſt, will anſwer to all the fears, doubts and objections of your ſouls: How ſhall I look up to God? the anſwer is, in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: how ſhall I have any communion with a holy God in this world? the anſwer is, in the righteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh ſirs, if you think of your ſins, and of God's wrath; if you think of your guiltineſs, and of God's juſtice; your hearts will faint and fail, they will fear and tremble, and ſink into deſpair; if you do not think of Chriſt, if you do not ſtay and reſt your ſouls upon the mediatory righteouſneſs of Chriſt, The Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. The Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, anſwers all cavils and objections (though there were millions of them) that can be made againſt the good eſtate of a believer. This is a precious truth more worth than a world, that all our ſins are pardoned, not only in a way of truth and mercy, but in a way of juſtice. Satan and our own conſciences will object many things againſt our ſouls, if we plead only the mercy and the truth of God; and will be ready to ſay, oh but where is then the juſtice of God? can mercy pardon without the conſent of his juſtice? but now, whilſt we reſt upon the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, <hi>juſtice and mercy kiſs</hi>

The infinite worth of Chriſt's obedience, did ariſe from the dignity of his perſon, who was God-man; ſo that all the obedience of Angels and men, if put together, could not amount to the excellency of Chriſt's ſatisfaction. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, is often called the righteouſneſs of God, becauſe it is a righteouſneſs of God's providing, and a righteouſneſs that God is fully ſatisfied with; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no fears, no doubts, no cavils, no objections, no diſputes can ſtand before this bleſſed and glorious righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:66517:187"/> of Jeſus Chriſt, that is imputed to us. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, know for your comfort, that the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Chriſt is the beſt title that you have to ſhew for <hi>a Kingdom that ſhakes not, for riches that corrupt not,</hi>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:66517:188"/> ſafe, and well, ſo the believer being abſolved before God's Tribunal ſeat, there is no further accuſations to be feared, all appeals from thence being void, and of no force: The conſideration of which ſhould arm us, and comfort us, and ſtrengthen us againſt all terrours of conſcience, guilt of ſin, accuſation of the Law, and cruelty of Satan; in as much as theſe either dare not appear before God, to accuſe us, or charge us; or if they do, it is but loſt labour. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> gives the ſence thus; None can or dare retract the judgment of God; for he confidently provoketh all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, if they dare come forth to accuſe; not that there is no cauſe, but becauſe God hath juſtified: <hi>It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> therefore it is in vain to accuſe them; and <hi>It is God that juſtifieth them,</hi> if God doth it, none can reverſe it, for there are none that are equal with God: Let all the accuſations, which ſhall come in againſt thee, from one hand or another, be true or falſe, they ſhall never hurt thee; for he, from whom there is no appeal, hath fully acquitted thee, and therefore no accuſation can endanger thy peace.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66517:192"/> ouſneſs of that perſon, which is both God and man. Look as the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was a far more excellent perſon, than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was: <hi>The firſt man was of the earth, earthy;</hi>

As he approves of, and accepts: 3. As he takes infinite pleaſure, and delight, and ſatisfaction in. The Righteouſneſs the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in that Scripture laſt mentioned, is not to be underſtood of the eſſential righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is infinite, and no ways communicable to the creature, unleſs we will make a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a God; but we are to underſtand it, of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, that is imputed to believers, as their ſin is imputed to him. Now, what a Well of ſalvation is here? what three noble grounds, and what matchleſs bottoms are here, for a Chriſtian's joy and triumph in Chriſt Jeſus? who hath put ſo glorious a Robe, as his own righteouſneſs upon them.

Joy in the face puts a new beauty upon a perſon, and makes that which before was beautiful, to be exceeding beautiful, it puts a luſtre upon beauty; ſo does holy joy and rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, put (as it were) a new beauty and luſtre upon Chriſt.

The right way to righteouſneſs for
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:66517:194"/> juſtification is by Chriſt, who is the way, the door, the truth, and the life; becauſe we want a righteouſneſs of our own, God hath aſſigned us the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is infinitely better than our own, yea, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our very lives, may I not ſay, yea better than our very ſouls. <hi>The branch Chriſt Jeſus is called Jehovah Tſidkenu, the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. <hi>And this is his name, whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS:</hi> Where note, firſt, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this name, is to be ſo really, for Chriſt is never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what he is not: and ſo he is, to the ſame purpoſe, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 23.</note> called <hi>Immanuel, God with us;</hi> that is, he ſhall be ſo indeed, <hi>God with us;</hi> ſo here he ſhall be called, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, he ſhall be ſo indeed. Secondly, obſerve this is one of his glorious names, that is, one of his Attributes, which he accounts his excellency, and his glory. Now all the attributes of Chriſt are unchangeable, ſo that he can as eaſily change his nature as his name. Now remember, that this imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures acceptance for our inherent righteouſneſs: when a ſincere Chriſtian caſts his eye upon the weakneſſes, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and imperfections, that daily attend his beſt ſervices, he ſighs and mourns; but if he looks upward, to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhall bring forth his infirm, weak and ſinful performances, perfect, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſinleſs, and approved according to the tenour of the Goſpel, ſo that they become ſpiritual ſacrifices, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> but rejoyce. For as there is an imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to the perſons of believers, ſo there is alſo, an imputation to their ſervices and actions: As the fact of <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Phineas,</hi> was imputed to him for righteouſneſs; ſo the imperfect good works that are done by believers, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteouſneſs, or (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks) are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for righteouſneſs, they being dipped in the blood of Chriſt: <hi>(tincta ſanguine Chriſti) i. e.</hi> they are accounted righteous actions; and ſo ſincere Chriſtians ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 18. cap. 20. 12. Mat. 25. 34, 35, 36, 37.</note> according to their good works, though not ſaved for them. And 'tis obſervable in that famous proceſs of the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66517:194"/> laſt judgment, that the ſupreme judge makes mention of the bounty and liberality of the Saints; and ſo beſtows the Crown of life, and the eternal inheritance upon them; ſo that, though the Lord's faithful ones have eminent cauſe to be humbled and afflicted, for the many weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that cleaves to their beſt duties; yet, on the other hand, they have wonderful cauſe to rejoyce and triumph, <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 6 11. Mal. 4. 2.</note> that they are made perfect through Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Lord looks at them (through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt) as fruits of his own ſpirit. The Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs hath healing enough in his wings, for all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Maladies: The Saints prayers, being perfumed with <note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3, 4.</note> Chriſt's odours, are highly accepted in heaven: Upon this bottom of Imputed Righteouſneſs, believers may have exceeding ſtrong conſolation, and good hope through grace; that both their perſons and ſervices do find ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acceptation with God, as having no ſpot or blemiſh at all in them: Surely Righteouſneſs imputed, muſt be the top of our happineſs and bleſſedneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5, 6. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly and laſtly, know for your comfort, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs will give you the greateſt boldneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> before God's Judgment-ſeat. There is an abſolute, and indiſpenſible neceſſity of a perfect Righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to appear before God: The holineſs of God's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the righteouſneſs of his Government, the ſeverity of his Law, and the terrour of wrath, calls aloud upon the ſinner for a compleat Righteouſneſs; without which, <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 5.</note> there is no ſtanding in judgment. That Righteouſneſs only, is able to juſtifie us before God, which is perfect, and that hath no defect nor blemiſh in it, ſuch as may abide the tryal before his Judgment-ſeat; ſuch as may fitly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his juſtice, and make our peace with him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuch, as whereby the Law of God is fulfilled. Therefore it is called the Righteouſneſs of God; ſuch a <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> Righteouſneſs as he requires, as will ſtand before him, and ſatisfie his juſtice: ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of the Law muſt be fulfilled in us.</hi> Now there is no other Righteouſneſs under heaven, whereby the Law
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:66517:195"/> of God was ever perfectly fulfilled, but by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt alone; no righteouſneſs below the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, was ever able to abide the tryal at God's judgment-ſeat; and fully to ſatisfie his juſtice, and pacifie his wrath. A gracious ſoul triumphs more in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt Imputed, than he would have done, if he could have ſtood, in the Righteouſneſs, in which he was created. This is the crowning comfort to a ſenſible and underſtanding ſoul, that he ſtands righteous before a Judgment-ſeat, in that full, exact, perfect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, matchleſs, ſpotleſs, pearleſs, and moſt acceptable Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him: The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this Chapter, as in a holy Armory, we may find, had I time to go through it many pointed daggers, and two-edged ſwords and ſhields of braſs, to arm us againſt the corrupt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and opinions of the blinded and deluded Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who fight with all their might againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt's ſubſtitution. <hi>(Ver. 4.)

Now what more clear and evident proofs can there be of Chriſt's ſuſception of the ſinners guilt, and of his bearing the puniſhment due for it.

Chriſt as our Surety laid down a ſatisfactory price, not only for our good, but alſo in our ſtead or room: 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Chriſt alſo hath ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God:</hi> What the unjuſt ſinner ſhould have ſuffered, that the juſt Chriſt ſuffered for him: 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. He was made ſin for us:</hi> (that is) an offering, a ſacrifice, in our ſtead, for the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:66517:204"/> expiation of our ſins. <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. Now Chriſt's becoming a curſe for us ſtands in this, That whereas we are all accurſed by the ſentence of the Law, becauſe of ſin; he now comes into our room, and ſtands under the ſtroke of that curſe, which of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us: ſo that it lies not now any longer on the backs of poor ſinners, but on him for them, and in their ſtead; therefore he is called a Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. The Surety ſtands in the room of a debtor, malefactor, or him that is any way obnoxious to the Law: Such is <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity. We are by the doom of the Law evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, tranſgreſſors, and upon that ſcore we ſtand indebted to the juſtice of God, and lie under the ſtroke of his wrath: Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſeeing us in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſteps in and ſtands between us and the blow; yea he takes this wrath and curſe off from us unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſtands not only or meerly after the manner of a Surety among men in the caſe of debt; for here the Surety enters bond with the Principal, for the payment of the debt, but yet expects that the debtor ſhould not put him to it, but that he ſhould diſcharge the debt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he only ſtands as a good ſecurity for the debtor; no, Chriſt Jeſus doth not expect that we ſhould pay the debt our ſelves, but he takes it wholly upon himſelf. As a ſurety for a murtherer or traytor. or ſome other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malefactor, that hath broken priſon and is run away; he lies by it body for body, ſtate for ſtate, and undergoes whatſoever the malefactor is chargeable withal for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Law. Even ſo the Lord Jeſus ſtands Surety for us runagate malefactors, making himſelf liable to all that curſe that belongs to us, that he might both anſwer the Law fully, and bring us back again to God: As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the room of all mankind fallen; ſo Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ſtands in the room of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that are to be reſtored, he ſuſtains the perſon of all thoſe which do ſpiritually deſcend from him, and unto whom he bears the relation of a Head. When God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his deareſt Son to be a Surety for us, and charged
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66517:205"/> all our debts upon him, and required an exact ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Law and Juſtice; inſomuch that he would not abate the Son of his love one farthing token of the debt; he did demonſtrate a greater love to Juſtice, than if he had damned as many worlds as there are men in the world, O let us never caſt an eye upon Chriſt's Surety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but let us ſtand and wonder, yea let us be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in a deep admiration of Chriſts love and of his Fathers impartial juſtice! Ah what tranſcendent wiſdom alſo does here: appear in reconciling the riches of Mercy and infinite Juſtice both in one, by the means of a Surety. If all the Angels in heaven and all the men on earth had been put to anſwer theſe Queſtions: How ſhall ſin be pardoned? how ſhall the ſinner be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and ſaved? how ſhall the wrath of God be pacified? how ſhall the Juſtice of God be ſatisfied? how ſhall the Redemption of Man be brought about, in ſuch a way whereby God may be moſt eminently glorified? they could never have anſwered the queſtions: But God in his infinite Wiſdom, hath found out a way to ſave ſinners, not only in a way of Mercy and Grace, but in a way of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; and all this by the means of Chriſt's Suretyſhip, as hath been already declared.</p>
            <p>Now from the conſideration of Chriſt's Suretyſhip, a believer may form up this Seventh, ſafe, comfortable and bleſſed Plea, as to the ten Scriptures formerly cited, that refer to the great day of account, or to a man's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account. O bleſſed Father, remember that thine own Son was my Ranſom, his blood was the price; he was my Surety, and undertook to anſwer for my ſins. I know, O bleſſed God, that thou muſt be ſatisfied, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <note place="margin">When a man matries a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with her perſon he takes her debts and ſatisfaction too; ſo does Chriſt, when he takes us to be his he takes our ſins alſo to be hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>btor. And thus the caſe ſtands between Chriſt and my ſoul; for as my Surety, he hath paid all my debts, and that very payment that he hath made, in honour and juſtice thou art obliged to accept of, as made in my ſtead. Oh deareſt Father! that Jeſus who is God-man as my Surety, he hath done all that the Law requireth of me, and thereby he hath freed me from wrath to come, and from the curſe that <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. ult.</note> was due to me for my ſins: This is my plea, O holy God, and by this plea I ſhall ſtand. Hereupon God declares, this plea I accept as juſt and good, and therefore <hi>enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>

            <p>Chriſtian Reader, I have gone as far in the opening and clearing up of thoſe Grand Points of the Goſpel that have fallen under our conſideration as I judge meet at this time. By the Title-page thou mayeſt ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:66517:206"/> that I have promiſed much more than in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I have performed; but be but a little patient, and by divine aſſiſtance, I ſhall make ſure and full payment. The Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with ſome other Points of high importance, I ſhall preſent to thee in the Second Part, which will be the Laſt Part. In this Firſt Part I don't offer thee that which coſt me nothing. I deſire that all the intereſt thou haſt in heaven may be ſo fully and duly improved, that this Firſt Part may be ſo bleſt from on high, as that Saints and Sinners may have cauſe to bleſs God to all Aeternity, for what is brought to hand; and beg hard, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part, which is drawn up and fitted for the Preſs, may alſo be crowned with many bleſſings: Hereby thout wilt put a high obligation upon the Author, to do all he can, to be yet a little further ſerviceable to thy ſoul and others, to thy ſalvation and others, before he goes hence and ſhall be ſeen no more.</p>
